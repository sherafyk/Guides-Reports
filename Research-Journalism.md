# How to Document Truth: A Citizen Journalist's Guide

## Introduction

Every day, important things happen in your community that never make the news. A local business quietly dumps waste. A school board makes decisions behind closed doors. A protest forms spontaneously. A neighbor shares a powerful story that needs to be heard.

**You can be the one who documents these truths.**

You don't need a journalism degree, expensive equipment, or permission from anyone. With a smartphone and the skills in this guide, you can become a citizen journalist—someone who witnesses, verifies, and shares what's really happening in your world.

**What makes citizen journalism powerful?**
- You're already there when news happens
- You know your community better than any outside reporter
- You can share stories that mainstream media misses or ignores
- Your voice and perspective matter

This guide will teach you how to:
- Document events as they happen
- Interview people effectively
- Verify information before sharing it
- Build credibility and trust
- Protect yourself and your sources
- Share your findings responsibly

**You already have what it takes.** If you can take a photo, write a social media post, or have a conversation, you can be a citizen journalist. Let's learn how to do it right.

## Section 1: From Observer to Reporter

The difference between watching something happen and reporting on it isn't as big as you might think. It's about being intentional—paying attention to details, asking questions, and documenting what you see.

### **The Mindset Shift: You're Not Just Watching, You're Witnessing**

When you decide to document something, you become more than a bystander. You're creating a record that could inform, protect, or inspire others. This means:

- **Being present and alert:** Notice details others might miss
- **Thinking about your audience:** What do people need to know?
- **Staying objective:** Document what IS, not just what you think about it

### **How to Document Events as They Happen**

**Before anything happens:**
- Keep your phone charged and have storage space
- Know your basic rights (can you legally record here?)
- Have a simple note-taking app ready

**When you're at the scene:**
1. **Safety first:** Never put yourself in danger for a story
2. **Document the basics:**
   - Where are you? (Street names, landmarks)
   - When is this happening? (Date, time)
   - What's occurring? (Just the facts)
   - Who's involved? (Without making assumptions)
   - Why is this happening? (If known)
   
3. **Capture evidence:**
   - Wide shots showing the whole scene
   - Close-ups of important details
   - Multiple angles when possible
   - Short video clips (30-60 seconds) of key moments

### **Taking Effective Photos and Videos as Evidence**

**For photos:**
- Hold your phone steady (use both hands)
- Get establishing shots first (show the whole scene)
- Capture identifying details (street signs, building numbers)
- Photograph any documents, signs, or written material
- Don't use filters or edits—keep images authentic

**For videos:**
- Start recording before the action
- Keep clips short and focused
- Narrate quietly what you're seeing
- Hold the phone horizontally for better framing
- Don't zoom while recording—it makes footage shaky

### **Writing Clear, Factual Accounts**

After documenting, write down what happened while it's fresh:

**Simple format:**
```
WHAT: [Brief description of event]
WHERE: [Specific location]
WHEN: [Date and time]
WHO: [People/groups involved]
WHAT HAPPENED: [Chronological account]
VERIFIED: [What you saw vs. what you heard]
QUESTIONS: [What you still need to find out]
```

**Example:**
"WHAT: Peaceful protest at City Hall
WHERE: 123 Main St, front steps
WHEN: March 5, 2024, 2:30 PM
WHO: Approximately 200 residents, organized by Local Housing Coalition
WHAT HAPPENED: Crowd gathered at 2:30, speakers began at 2:45, police arrived at 3:15 but did not intervene, protest ended peacefully at 4:00
VERIFIED: I personally saw and photographed the crowd size, speakers, and police presence
QUESTIONS: What specific policy changes are protesters demanding? City's official response?"

### **The Difference Between Witnessing and Reporting**

**Witnessing:** "I saw something happen"
**Reporting:** "Here's what happened, here's how I know, here's what it means, and here's what I still need to find out"

As a citizen journalist, you're doing both—being a credible witness AND helping others understand what occurred.

## Section 2: The Art of the Interview

Getting people to share their stories is one of the most powerful tools in journalism. You don't need to be a professional reporter—you just need to be respectful, prepared, and genuinely interested in what people have to say.

### **How to Approach Sources Respectfully**

**Before approaching someone:**
- Have a clear, honest introduction ready
- Respect their space and situation
- Be prepared for "no"—and accept it gracefully

**Your introduction template:**
"Hi, I'm [name], and I'm documenting [event/issue] to share with our community. Would you be willing to share your perspective? I can keep you anonymous if you prefer."

**Building trust:**
- Be transparent about why you're asking
- Let them know how their words will be used
- Give them control over their participation
- Follow through on any promises you make

### **Asking Open-Ended Questions**

Good questions get good stories. Avoid yes/no questions—instead, invite people to explain and elaborate.

**Instead of:** "Are you upset about this?"
**Try:** "How has this affected you?"

**Instead of:** "Do you support the protest?"
**Try:** "What brought you here today?"

**Great starter questions:**
- "Can you help me understand...?"
- "What do you think people should know about...?"
- "Can you walk me through what happened?"
- "How did you feel when...?"
- "What do you hope happens next?"

### **Recording Conversations (Legally and Ethically)**

**Legal basics:**
- In many places, you need consent to record
- When in doubt, always ask permission
- Some states require all parties to consent
- Public spaces often have different rules than private

**How to ask:**
"I'd like to record this to make sure I get your words right. Is that okay with you?"

**Best practices:**
- Start recording AFTER getting permission
- State the date, location, and who's speaking
- Use a simple voice recorder app
- Have a backup method (notes)
- Save original files—don't edit

### **Verifying What People Tell You**

People can be wrong, confused, or have incomplete information—even when they're being honest.

**During the interview:**
- Ask "How do you know that?"
- Request specifics: dates, names, places
- Note what they saw vs. what they heard
- Ask for documents or other evidence

**After the interview:**
- Fact-check claims against other sources
- Look for documents that confirm details
- Talk to other witnesses
- Be transparent about what you could/couldn't verify

**Remember:** Your job isn't to catch people lying—it's to make sure the information you share is accurate.

## Section 3: Journalism in Action

Real journalism happens in the real world. Here are practical scenarios where your citizen journalism skills can make a difference.

### **Documenting a Local Protest or Community Event**

**Before you go:**
- Check if organizers have made public statements
- Know the basic issue being protested
- Charge your phone and clear storage space
- Dress neutrally—you're there to document, not participate

**On scene:**
- Get there early to document setup
- Photograph crowd sizes at different times
- Interview diverse voices (organizers, participants, bystanders)
- Document any police or official response
- Note any counter-protesters

**Key shots to get:**
- Wide shot of the full crowd
- Signs and banners (these tell the story)
- Speakers and crowd reactions
- Any interactions with authorities
- The ending—how things conclude matters

### **Investigating Local Government Decisions**

**Where to start:**
- Attend public meetings (city council, school board)
- Request public records (meeting minutes, budgets)
- Talk to affected community members
- Compare what officials say vs. what documents show

**What to document:**
- Who voted for what
- Which community members spoke up
- What questions went unanswered
- Any conflicts of interest

**Following the money:**
- Who benefits from decisions?
- What contracts were awarded?
- How are tax dollars being spent?
- Are there connections between officials and beneficiaries?

### **Fact-Checking Viral Claims in Your Community**

When something goes viral locally:

1. **Screenshot everything immediately** (posts get deleted)
2. **Find the original source** of the claim
3. **Check with official sources** (police, city, hospitals)
4. **Talk to actual witnesses**
5. **Document the spread** of misinformation
6. **Share your findings** with corrections

**Example:** "Local Facebook post claims all schools closing tomorrow due to threat"
- Check official school district website/social media
- Call district office for statement
- Check police reports
- Document how many shares before verified
- Post findings with evidence

### **Reporting on Local Business Practices**

**Environmental concerns:**
- Document visible pollution or dumping
- Photograph before/after conditions
- Interview affected neighbors
- Check public permit records
- Contact relevant agencies

**Labor issues:**
- Talk to workers (protect their identities)
- Document working conditions
- Check wage theft databases
- Research owner's other businesses
- Compare promises to reality

**Consumer problems:**
- Collect multiple similar complaints
- Document pattern of issues
- Check Better Business Bureau records
- Interview affected customers
- Seek company response

## Section 4: Understanding Sources and Verification

Good journalism stands on solid sources. Here's how to find them, evaluate them, and use them responsibly.

### **Primary vs. Secondary Sources**

**Primary sources** = Direct evidence
- Eyewitnesses you interview
- Official documents you obtain
- Photos/videos you or witnesses take
- Direct statements from officials
- Original data or reports

**Secondary sources** = Someone else's reporting
- News articles
- Social media posts
- What someone heard from someone else
- Summaries or interpretations

**Rule:** Always try to get as close to primary sources as possible.

### **Evaluating Source Credibility**

Ask these questions about every source:

**Who are they?**
- What's their real name and role?
- Do they have direct knowledge?
- What's their track record?
- Could they have bias or agenda?

**How do they know?**
- Were they there?
- Did they see documents?
- Are they repeating hearsay?
- Can they provide evidence?

### **The Verification Checklist**

Before publishing any claim:

✓ **Multiple sources:** At least two independent sources
✓ **Direct knowledge:** Sources who actually know, not guess
✓ **Evidence:** Documents, photos, or recordings when possible
✓ **Context:** The full story, not just fragments
✓ **Other side:** Response from accused parties
✓ **Transparency:** What you know AND don't know

### **When Sources Want Anonymity**

Sometimes people need protection to share important information.

**Good reasons for anonymity:**
- Fear of job loss
- Safety concerns
- Immigration status
- Whistleblowing

**How to handle:**
- Verify their identity privately
- Confirm their information through other sources
- Be clear about level of protection
- Keep careful records (stored safely)
- Consider if the story is worth the risk

**How to cite anonymous sources:**
- "A city employee who requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation said..."
- "Three workers, who asked not to be named because they still need their jobs, confirmed..."

## Section 5: Fact-Checking in Real Time

When news breaks, misinformation spreads faster than ever. Here's how to verify information quickly without sacrificing accuracy.

### **Quick Verification Tools**

**For images:**
- Google Image Search: Drag and drop to check if an image is old or from elsewhere
- TinEye: Finds where images appeared before
- Screenshot immediately: Images/posts often get deleted

**For videos:**
- InVID: Breaks videos into frames for reverse searching
- YouTube DataViewer: Shows exact upload time
- Look for edits: Jumpy footage, mismatched audio

**For claims:**
- Check official sources first (police, fire, city websites)
- Search the exact quote in quotation marks
- Look for multiple independent confirmations
- Check if trusted journalists are reporting it

### **The 5-Minute Fact Check**

When you see breaking news:

1. **Source check (1 min):** Who's saying this? Are they credible?
2. **Date check (30 sec):** Is this actually new or recycled?
3. **Image check (1 min):** Reverse search any photos
4. **Corroboration (2 min):** Who else credible is reporting?
5. **Logic check (30 sec):** Does this make sense?

### **Red Flags for Fake News**

Watch for:
- "BREAKING" with no major outlets reporting
- Emotional language designed to anger/scare
- No specific sources ("people are saying")
- Requests to "share before they delete this!"
- Graphics with no source attribution
- Claims that "media won't report this"

### **Creating a Verification Trail**

Document your fact-checking:

```
CLAIM: [What's being claimed]
SOURCE: [Who's making the claim]
VERIFIED:
- ✓ [What you confirmed]
- ✗ [What you disproved]
- ? [What remains unclear]
EVIDENCE: [Links, screenshots, sources]
CONCLUSION: [Your assessment]
```

This transparency builds trust and helps others learn.

"Water Main Break Floods Downtown Businesses

A water main break at 3rd and Main Street flooded six businesses Tuesday morning, causing thousands in damage and closing the downtown corridor for five hours.

The break occurred at 6:45 AM according to City Water Department spokesperson Jane Smith. Water rushed into street-level shops, with Ace Hardware and Main Street Cafe reporting the most damage.

'We lost most of our inventory on the floor,' said Tom Chen, Ace Hardware owner. 'Probably $10,000 in damage.'

City workers repaired the pipe by noon, but business owners say they need help with cleanup costs. The city says insurance claims should be filed by Friday.

This is the third water main break downtown this year. The city council will discuss infrastructure updates at Thursday's meeting.

*I witnessed the flooding, interviewed three business owners, and confirmed details with city officials. I live two blocks from the affected area.*"

## Section 11: Ethics and Responsibility

With the power to inform comes responsibility. Here are ethical guidelines every citizen journalist should follow.

### **Core Principles**

**Seek truth and provide accurate information:**
- Verify before publishing
- Don't guess or assume
- Correct errors promptly
- Be honest about limitations

**Minimize harm:**
- Consider consequences of publication
- Be sensitive to victims
- Protect vulnerable sources
- Avoid graphic content unless essential

**Act independently:**
- Disclose conflicts of interest
- Refuse gifts or favors
- Don't promise positive coverage
- Maintain editorial independence

**Be accountable:**
- Explain your methods
- Respond to questions
- Accept criticism gracefully
- Admit mistakes openly

### **Common Ethical Dilemmas**

**"Should I publish this?"**
Ask yourself:
- Is it true and verified?
- Does public benefit outweigh harm?
- Have I been fair to all parties?
- Would I want this published about me?

**"This will get lots of clicks but..."**
If you're hesitating, there's usually a reason. Trust your instincts over metrics.

**"My source asked me not to include this detail"**
Respect reasonable requests unless:
- It's crucial to the story
- Omitting it would mislead
- Public interest overrides

### **Special Considerations**

**Minors:**
- Extra protection needed
- Parental permission usually required
- Consider long-term impact
- Use first names only if needed

**Victims:**
- Respect privacy and dignity
- Don't assume consent
- Consider trauma impact
- Offer anonymity

**Graphic content:**
- Clear warnings required
- Consider if necessary
- Respect human dignity
- Think of families

### **The Public Interest Test**

Before publishing sensitive information, ask:
- Does this help people make decisions?
- Does it expose wrongdoing?
- Does it protect public safety?
- Does it reveal important truths?

If yes, publication may be justified. If no, reconsider.

5. Is the PUBLIC INTEREST served?
