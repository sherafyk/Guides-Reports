Underutilized Low-Effort Funding Opportunities in California (2025)
===================================================================

**Overview:** This report identifies *legitimate, low-risk, and underutilized ways to receive money or financial value* from government, quasi-governmental, nonprofit, utility, and regulated programs. It is tailored for a California resident (Los Angeles County) who is a U.S. citizen and business owner (LLCs/S-Corps), seeking "easy money" -- i.e. high return on time/effort, without fraud, debt, or speculative schemes. The opportunities are grouped by category, each with key details: program authority, who qualifies, typical payout, effort required, ways to leverage specialized knowledge, how to access the benefit, why it's underutilized, and an official source citation. A strategic analysis follows, ranking the best low-effort/high-ROI plays, suggesting stackable strategies, outlining business models to facilitate these programs for others, and noting risks and compliance considerations.

1. Direct Cash & Claimable Funds
--------------------------------

These are one-time or periodic *cash windfalls* that individuals or businesses can claim from existing pools of money. Often they arise from forgotten assets, legal settlements, or refunds. **Knowledge and awareness are key** -- billions of dollars lie unclaimed simply because people don't know to ask for them.

**California Unclaimed Property (State Controller's Office)** -- California's unclaimed property program holds *over $10--15 billion* in dormant financial assets (bank accounts, stocks, uncashed checks, insurance payouts, safe deposit box contents, etc.) turned over by businesses after periods of inactivity[*[1]*](http://www.comstocksmag.com/longreads/how-california-government-escheated-its-way-13-billion-peoples-money#:~:text=The%20state%E2%80%99s%20unclaimed%20property%20law,largest%20source%20of%20annual%20revenue)[*[2]*](https://www.claimnotify.org/blogs/california-unclaimed-funds-2025#:~:text=California%20maintains%20the%20nation%27s%20largest,businesses%20throughout%20the%20Golden%20State).

- **Administering Authority:** California State Controller's Office, Unclaimed Property Division (under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act)[*[1]*](http://www.comstocksmag.com/longreads/how-california-government-escheated-its-way-13-billion-peoples-money#:~:text=The%20state%E2%80%99s%20unclaimed%20property%20law,largest%20source%20of%20annual%20revenue).

- **Who Qualifies:** *Any individual or business* that is the rightful owner of abandoned assets reported in California. (Other states have similar programs -- one should search every state lived or done business in.)

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Ranges widely. Many claims are small ($50--$100)[*[3]*](https://www.claimnotify.org/blogs/california-unclaimed-funds-2025#:~:text=%2A%20%240%20,of%20total), but higher-value claims (over $50k) also exist, with large claims averaging over $117,000[*[4]*](https://www.claimnotify.org/blogs/california-unclaimed-funds-2025#:~:text=%2A%20%242%2C000%20,of%20total). California holds **83+ million unclaimed properties** worth ~$11.68 billion total[*[2]*](https://www.claimnotify.org/blogs/california-unclaimed-funds-2025#:~:text=California%20maintains%20the%20nation%27s%20largest,businesses%20throughout%20the%20Golden%20State)[*[5]*](https://www.claimnotify.org/blogs/california-unclaimed-funds-2025#:~:text=,of%20new%20claims%20processed%20monthly). In Los Angeles County alone, nearly *$2.58 billion* is unclaimed[*[6]*](https://www.claimnotify.org/blogs/california-unclaimed-funds-2025#:~:text=California%27s%20county,patterns%20in%20unclaimed%20property%20accumulation).

- **Effort Level:** **Low.** Simply search the free online database and file a claim with proof of identity/ownership[*[7]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=,the%20value%20of%20the%20property). The claim form is straightforward, though processing may take weeks. There is *no fee* to claim your own property.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** A savvy person can systematically search multiple databases (state, federal, insurance, etc.) to uncover assets for themselves and others. California allows professional "asset locators" (investigators) to assist claimants for a commission capped at 10% of value[*[8]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=,asset%20investigators). By knowing the rules (e.g. in CA, investigators can only contact owners after the state has held the property for at least 7 months, and fees are legally limited[*[9]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=TIPS%3A)[*[10]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=,the%20value%20of%20the%20property)), one could ethically operate a recovery service. Specialized knowledge can also help locate less obvious funds (e.g. old stock dividends or tax refunds).

- **How to Apply or Access:** Use the official California State Controller **online search** (claimit.ca.gov) or the multi-state NAUPA portal (MissingMoney.com) to find unclaimed property[*[11]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=than%2010%20percent%20of%20the,value%20of%20the%20property). Submit a claim form online or by mail with required verification (ID, proof of address or ownership). There is no cost. Claims can also be made for deceased relatives (with probate documentation).

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Lack of awareness** -- millions of people never check these databases. The state makes only minimal effort to find owners (California's Controller reunites owners with only a portion of seized property)[*[1]*](http://www.comstocksmag.com/longreads/how-california-government-escheated-its-way-13-billion-peoples-money#:~:text=The%20state%E2%80%99s%20unclaimed%20property%20law,largest%20source%20of%20annual%20revenue), and the rest bolsters the state budget. In fact, unclaimed property has become California's *5th-largest revenue source* because so many assets remain unclaimed[*[1]*](http://www.comstocksmag.com/longreads/how-california-government-escheated-its-way-13-billion-peoples-money#:~:text=The%20state%E2%80%99s%20unclaimed%20property%20law,largest%20source%20of%20annual%20revenue). Many assume small old accounts aren't worth the hassle, or simply don't know they exist. It's truly "easy money" for those who take the few minutes to look.

- **Official Source/Citation:** California State Controller's Office -- Unclaimed Property Program (public data indicates the state holds ~$14 billion in unclaimed assets)[*[1]*](http://www.comstocksmag.com/longreads/how-california-government-escheated-its-way-13-billion-peoples-money#:~:text=The%20state%E2%80%99s%20unclaimed%20property%20law,largest%20source%20of%20annual%20revenue).

**Local Government Uncashed Checks (County/City)** -- Counties and cities in California often have *uncashed warrants* (checks) issued to individuals or businesses that were never cashed or delivered. These might be refunds, vendor payments, jury duty stipends, restitution payments, etc., sitting in local coffers until claimed.

- **Administering Authority:** Typically the County Auditor-Controller or City Finance Department. (For example, Los Angeles County's Auditor-Controller maintains a public website for uncashed checks issued by the county)[*[12]*](https://unclaimedchecks.lacounty.gov/Welcome#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20the%20County%20of,someone%20other%20than%20the%20payee)[*[13]*](https://unclaimedchecks.lacounty.gov/Welcome#:~:text=Search%20and%20claim%20from%20our,checks%C2%A0from%206%20months%C2%A0to%205%C2%A0years%20old).

- **Who Qualifies:** The payees of the outstanding checks -- could be *both individuals or businesses* who at some point were to receive a payment from the county/city (and whose check got lost, expired, or was never deposited).

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Often $10--$1,000 per check, but can be higher. These are funds already owed (not a grant), so the full value is claimable. LA County's inventory includes checks from 6 months to 5 years old[*[14]*](https://unclaimedchecks.lacounty.gov/Welcome#:~:text=Search%20and%20claim%20from%20our,checks%C2%A0from%206%20months%C2%A0to%205%C2%A0years%20old). (After a period, unclaimed funds may revert to the government if not claimed.)

- **Effort Level:** **Low.** Searching local published lists or databases and submitting a claim form is simple. Many counties list names and amounts in newspapers or online periodically. Identification and possibly proof of address or original transaction may be required.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** A knowledgeable person can monitor these local lists (often called "unclaimed checks" or "undelivered warrants") and proactively inform potential claimants. While public agencies do not pay finders for this, one could charge a small service fee (where legal) or use it as goodwill/marketing to attract clients. Since **the data is public**, a skilled researcher could find dozens of businesses in their area owed money and help them claim it.

- **How to Apply or Access:** Check your county's unclaimed funds website or Clerk's notices. For LA County, for example, one can search the official online tool by name and submit an electronic claim or mail in a form[*[12]*](https://unclaimedchecks.lacounty.gov/Welcome#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20the%20County%20of,someone%20other%20than%20the%20payee)[*[13]*](https://unclaimedchecks.lacounty.gov/Welcome#:~:text=Search%20and%20claim%20from%20our,checks%C2%A0from%206%20months%C2%A0to%205%C2%A0years%20old). City governments (e.g. City of Los Angeles, City of Glendale) also periodically post lists of unclaimed checks on their websites or city bulletins[*[15]*](https://www.glendaleca.gov/Home/Components/News/News/9420/2129#:~:text=City%20News%20,notice%2C%20the%20funds%20will). Follow the instructions provided, which usually involve proving you are the payee or authorized agent.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** These local unclaimed funds get far less publicity than state unclaimed property. Many people have no idea the county tried to pay them. The notice might have been a small legal ad or a letter to an old address. Because the amounts are often modest, claimants don't prioritize them or assume it's a scam. As a result, governments end up keeping much of this money after deadlines pass (for instance, if not claimed within a year or three years, depending on the jurisdiction, it escheats to the general fund)[*[16]*](https://www.sbcountyatc.gov/tax-collector/tax-sale/excess-proceeds#:~:text=tax%20collector%20,by%20law%20begin%20the).

- **Official Source/Citation:** Los Angeles County Unclaimed Checks Portal (Auditor-Controller)[*[12]*](https://unclaimedchecks.lacounty.gov/Welcome#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20the%20County%20of,someone%20other%20than%20the%20payee), which allows searching for and claiming county-issued payments that were never cashed.

**Excess Proceeds from Tax Sales (Foreclosure Surplus)** -- When a property is sold at a county tax-default auction for more than the taxes and debts owed, the extra money is held as "excess proceeds." The *former owner or other parties* (lienholders, heirs) are legally entitled to claim this surplus, which can be **tens of thousands of dollars** (or more) in windfall cash[*[17]*](https://ttc.lacounty.gov/notice-of-excess-proceeds/#:~:text=The%20Treasurer%20and%20Tax%20Collector,the%20taxes%2C%20penalties%20and%20costs)[*[18]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=When%20property%20is%20sold%20at,claim%20by%20Parties%20of%20Interest).

- **Administering Authority:** County Treasurer-Tax Collectors in California. After a tax-defaulted property is sold, the county holds the excess funds in trust, usually for up to one year for claims[*[19]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=,filed). (E.g. Los Angeles County Treasurer-Tax Collector handles excess proceeds for LA County sales[*[20]*](https://ttc.lacounty.gov/notice-of-excess-proceeds/#:~:text=The%20Treasurer%20and%20Tax%20Collector,the%20taxes%2C%20penalties%20and%20costs).)

- **Who Qualifies:** *"Parties of interest"* as defined by law -- typically the property's former owner, their estate/heirs, or lienholders of record (such as mortgage lenders or judgment creditors)[*[21]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=,Interest)[*[22]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=California%20Revenue%20and%20Taxation%20Code,priority%20for%20paying%20on%20claims). These parties are notified by mail at last known address after the sale[*[23]*](https://ttc.lacounty.gov/notice-of-excess-proceeds/#:~:text=taxes%2C%20penalties%20and%20costs). If multiple parties claim, funds are distributed by priority (lienholders first, owner gets any remainder)[*[22]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=California%20Revenue%20and%20Taxation%20Code,priority%20for%20paying%20on%20claims).

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Highly variable, but often **significant**. Excess proceeds occur when a property sells at auction above the tax lien and fees. For example, if $20,000 in taxes were owed but the property sold for $200,000, around $180,000 would be excess proceeds for the former owner or creditors. Many claims are in the tens of thousands. (Counties only bother with excess > $150 by law[*[24]*](https://ttc.lacounty.gov/notice-of-excess-proceeds/#:~:text=No%20later%20than%2090%20days,defaulted%20property).) Unclaimed surpluses after the claim period end up as county revenue.

- **Effort Level:** **Low to Medium.** Filing a claim involves filling out a form and providing proof of identity and interest in the property (deed, lien documents, etc.)[*[25]*](https://ttc.lacounty.gov/notice-of-excess-proceeds/#:~:text=Parties%20of%20interest%20may%20file,instructions%20and%20forms%20listed%20below)[*[26]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=,of%20Interest%20need%20to%20submit). The process can be somewhat bureaucratic, and if multiple claimants are involved or the amount is large, it might require patience and possibly legal guidance. Still, for an entitled owner, this is essentially "found money" for minimal paperwork.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** There is a niche industry of *"excess proceeds locators"* who track auction results and then offer to help former owners claim their money for a fee. In California, parties of interest *may assign their claim rights to an agent* or have an agent file on their behalf[*[27]*](https://ttc.lacounty.gov/notice-of-excess-proceeds/#:~:text=State%20law%20allows%20parties%20of,the%20Treasurer%20and%20Tax%20Collector)[*[28]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=,Proceeds%20on%20my%20behalf). To do this legally, one must fully disclose the amount and the owner's rights, and the owner must sign an assignment; fees are implicitly limited by fairness (and in some states, explicitly capped). A knowledgeable person could become an authorized agent to navigate the claim on behalf of owners who are unaware or overwhelmed -- earning a percentage. **Important:** California law requires disclosure of the surplus amount to the owner and prohibits filing claims after one year[*[19]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=,filed), so working quickly and transparently is key. Because many owners have moved or lack financial savvy, an honest facilitator can add value here.

- **How to Apply:** The county will have a **Claim for Excess Proceeds** form (often downloadable from the Treasurer-Tax Collector's website)[*[27]*](https://ttc.lacounty.gov/notice-of-excess-proceeds/#:~:text=State%20law%20allows%20parties%20of,the%20Treasurer%20and%20Tax%20Collector). One must submit the form within **one year** of the tax deed recording[*[19]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=,filed), with documentation proving their interest (e.g. former titleholder must show they owned the property; a lienholder shows the recorded lien). No fee is required if filing on one's own. After a waiting period (in CA, counties actually wait until the one-year deadline passes before disbursing, to gather all claims), the county will pay out to valid claimants[*[19]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=,filed).

- **Why Underutilized:** **Lack of awareness and urgency.** Many foreclosed property owners do not realize they are entitled to surplus funds -- they may be emotionally distressed from losing the property and ignore mail from the county. The notices might not reach them if they've moved. Others assume any money automatically went to the bank or the government. Moreover, by law counties often *cannot proactively pay* until claims are filed, and once the deadline passes, the money is lost to the owner. This creates a scenario where *millions of dollars in excess sale proceeds statewide go unclaimed*. The process can also be confusing (legal language, need for notarization, etc.), deterring people from acting promptly.

- **Official Source/Citation:** Los Angeles County Treasurer-Tax Collector -- **Notice of Excess Proceeds** info page[*[17]*](https://ttc.lacounty.gov/notice-of-excess-proceeds/#:~:text=The%20Treasurer%20and%20Tax%20Collector,the%20taxes%2C%20penalties%20and%20costs)[*[27]*](https://ttc.lacounty.gov/notice-of-excess-proceeds/#:~:text=State%20law%20allows%20parties%20of,the%20Treasurer%20and%20Tax%20Collector) (explains who can claim and the claim process under CA Revenue & Taxation Code §4675).

**Unclaimed Federal Tax Refunds** -- The IRS each year holds *over $1 billion in unclaimed income tax refunds* for people who did not file returns to claim their refunds[*[29]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%95%20The%20Internal%20Revenue,by%20the%20April%2015%20deadline). If you had taxes withheld or paid estimated tax but didn't file (perhaps thinking you didn't need to), you could be owed a refund that the IRS will pay out once you file the return. After 3 years, however, those unclaimed refunds **expire and are lost** to the Treasury[*[30]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=below%20shows%20how%20many%20taxpayers,median%20refund%20in%20each%20state), so acting before the window closes is crucial.

- **Administering Authority:** Internal Revenue Service (federal). State tax agencies also hold unclaimed state tax refunds if, for example, a check wasn't delivered or a return wasn't filed. (California's FTB, for instance, might send a notice of an unused refund credit.)

- **Who Qualifies:** Individuals (or businesses) who are *entitled to a tax refund* by law but haven't received it because they failed to file a return or the check was undeliverable. Common cases: students or part-time workers with taxes withheld who had low income, people who missed the filing deadline due to life events, or anyone who overpaid. Also, people who did file but never received the check can request a reissue.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** The median unclaimed federal refund is around **$800** (for example, for 2021 refunds it was ~$781)[*[31]*](https://www.taxfyle.com/blog/unclaimed-tax-refunds-from-2021#:~:text=Deadline%3F%20www,deadline%20to%20file%20and), but many are larger. In total, over **1.1 million people** had unclaimed 2021 refunds averaging $900+ each[*[29]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%95%20The%20Internal%20Revenue,by%20the%20April%2015%20deadline). Some individuals could have several thousand dollars especially if refundable tax credits (Earned Income Credit, etc.) were involved[*[32]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=fail%20to%20file%20their%202021,84%20or%20other%20applicable%20credits). State refund amounts vary but often similar magnitude.

- **Effort Level:** **Low.** It requires preparing and filing the past tax return. This could be as simple as using tax software or forms for that year. The main "effort" is obtaining any needed documents (W-2s, 1099s), but the IRS provides help (you can request wage transcripts, etc.)[*[33]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=Plan%20to%20file%3F%20IRS%20offers,options%20to%20get%20key%20documents). There is *no penalty* for late filing if you're due a refund[*[30]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=below%20shows%20how%20many%20taxpayers,median%20refund%20in%20each%20state). One must file within 3 years of the original deadline (e.g. April 2025 is the last chance to claim 2021 refunds)[*[30]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=below%20shows%20how%20many%20taxpayers,median%20refund%20in%20each%20state).

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Tax knowledge can help identify if you or others are missing refunds. For instance, *low-income individuals may not realize they qualify for refundable credits like EITC* -- a tax preparer or advisor could find such cases and help them file, possibly for a fee or through a grant-funded VITA program. Businesses with credit carryforwards or overpayments might also leave money on the table that an accountant can retrieve by amending returns. Essentially, knowing the tax code and statutes of limitation can turn unclaimed refunds into quick cash before they expire.

- **How to Apply:** File the missing tax return (federal Form 1040 for the year in question). If you need old W-2s or 1099s, you can request a *Wage and Income Transcript* from the IRS or contact employers[*[34]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=,49%20Forms%2C%20instructions%20and). If a refund check was issued but lost/expired, submit Form 3911 to trace it or call the IRS. For California state refunds, contact the Franchise Tax Board or use their "Check refund status" tool -- if it shows a refund issued but not received, you can request a new check.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** Procrastination and ignorance of the deadline. Many people, especially those with low income, don't realize *filing can give them money back* (they may think "I didn't earn enough to file" and miss credits/refunds)[*[32]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=fail%20to%20file%20their%202021,84%20or%20other%20applicable%20credits). Others intend to file but miss the deadline and assume they lost out (not realizing the 3-year grace period). Additionally, if an old address was on file, checks may have been returned -- the IRS doesn't always aggressively track you down if you're not filing. This under-claiming is so severe that over a **billion dollars each year** never gets claimed[*[29]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%95%20The%20Internal%20Revenue,by%20the%20April%2015%20deadline). It's truly free money left on the table due to inertia.

- **Official Source/Citation:** IRS News Release IR-2025-46 (April 11, 2025) -- *"More than $1 billion in 2021 tax refunds still unclaimed"*[*[29]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%95%20The%20Internal%20Revenue,by%20the%20April%2015%20deadline) (details the number of people and average refund, urging taxpayers to file and claim their money).

**Class Action Settlement Claims** -- Large class-action lawsuits (over consumer products, data breaches, etc.) often result in settlement funds that eligible class members can claim. *Millions of dollars go unclaimed* in these settlements because people either aren't aware or fail to submit a claim[*[35]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Image%3A%20ree)[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why). If you've ever bought a certain product or been a customer of a company facing a class-action, you could get a small (or sometimes substantial) payment by simply filling out an online claim form.

- **Administering Authority:** Court-appointed **Settlement Administrators** (private firms) handle the claims process, under the oversight of the attorneys and the court. Official settlement websites are set up for each case. Government agencies sometimes facilitate awareness (e.g. the FTC publishes some refund notices), but generally these are quasi-private processes resulting from litigation.

- **Who Qualifies:** It depends on the case -- generally *consumers or businesses that are members of the "class"* defined in a lawsuit. For example: "All individuals in the U.S. who purchased XYZ product between 2018--2020" or "All California residents whose data was breached in Incident ABC." If you fit the criteria (often broadly, with no need to show personal harm), you're eligible to file a claim. Both individuals and businesses can be class members (businesses often qualify in antitrust settlements, e.g. merchants in a price-fixing case).

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Varies *widely*. Many consumer settlements pay in the range of $10 -- $100 per claimant (e.g. a $50 million fund split among hundreds of thousands of people). Some are symbolic amounts or vouchers. However, certain cases can pay hundreds or thousands per claim (especially if few people file, each gets a larger share). For businesses in large commercial settlements, refunds can be **tens of thousands of dollars** if their transaction volumes were high. Notably, it's estimated that **up to ~70% of eligible companies don't file claims**[*[37]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=products%20or%20services%20during%20the,period%20are%20entitled%20to%20recover), meaning those who do file may get a bigger piece. Unclaimed portions might revert to the defendants or be redistributed to those who claimed[*[38]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Why%20Unclaimed%20Settlement%20Funds%20Hurt) (or given to charity via *cy pres*).

- **Effort Level:** **Low.** Typically, one needs to fill out a claim form (online or paper) providing basic info and affirming you were affected (e.g. "I bought this product during the period" -- sometimes with proof of purchase, but often none required for small amounts). Monitoring which settlements you're eligible for is the main work. There are free websites and newsletters (like TopClassActions.com) that list open settlements. Filing each claim may take 5--10 minutes. For business-related settlements, you might need to provide purchase records or estimates, which is a bit more work but still a good ROI.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** A person who stays informed about settlements can **collect multiple payouts over time** by systematically claiming what they're entitled to. For example, there have been class settlements over credit card fees, phone bills, car purchases, tech devices, etc. -- savvy individuals sometimes make a hobby of submitting claims and might net a few hundred dollars a year. On a larger scale, consultants exist who help companies recover *their share of class-action settlements* (for a contingency fee). They use expertise to identify relevant cases (especially antitrust settlements) and handle the paperwork, which *recovers money the company didn't even know was available*[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why)[*[38]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Why%20Unclaimed%20Settlement%20Funds%20Hurt). This is a classic knowledge-leverage play: knowing where the "free money" pools are.

- **How to Apply:** Find the official settlement website (usually "[CaseName]Settlement.com"). The *class notice* or emails to class members will have instructions. Complete the claim form by the deadline, online if possible. Provide any required info (sometimes just your contact info and an attestation, other times an account number or proof of purchase). Then wait -- after the claims deadline and final court approval, checks or electronic payments are sent. No lawyers are needed for individual claims. **Warning:** Never pay to file a claim; legitimate settlements won't charge a fee. If using a third-party service for a business claim, ensure their cut is reasonable (and note that *no one is required to use a third-party* -- it's just for convenience)[*[39]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=How%20MCAG%20Makes%20the%20Process,Easier)[*[40]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=,get%20paid%20if%20you%20recover).

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Awareness and effort.** Many class members either *don't know* about the settlement or *don't bother* to claim. Notices might be mailed or emailed, but they look like junk mail and are ignored. Small-dollar settlements especially see low participation rates -- people think it's not worth $10, not realizing it accumulates or that unclaimed money essentially "returns to the bad actor." Businesses often fail to claim because the notices got lost in corporate bureaucracy or they didn't keep purchase records handy[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why)[*[38]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Why%20Unclaimed%20Settlement%20Funds%20Hurt). Additionally, confusion and skepticism ("Is this legit?") lead to inaction. The result: **billions of dollars** from settlements go unclaimed every year[*[35]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Image%3A%20ree). With just a bit of paperwork, one can scoop up value that others leave behind.

- **Official Source/Citation:** Managed Care Advisory Group analysis (June 2025) -- *"Every year, billions of dollars from class action and commercial settlements go unclaimed... estimates suggest roughly 70% of eligible companies don't file claims"*[*[35]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Image%3A%20ree)[*[37]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=products%20or%20services%20during%20the,period%20are%20entitled%20to%20recover). (This highlights the scale of under-claiming; specific settlement notices can be found on official settlement websites or via the Federal Trade Commission's consumer refunds page.)

**Restitution and Settlement Funds for Victims** -- In some cases, government agencies or courts hold funds that are owed to individuals as victims of crimes or wrongful acts. Examples include criminal restitution funds (if a defendant paid restitution but the victim could not be located), compensation from government enforcement actions (e.g. the FTC or CFPB securing refunds for consumers), or other settlement pools where individuals have to step forward to claim their share.

- **Administering Authority:** This varies. **Courts** often hold criminal restitution in trust. Agencies like the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** maintain dashboards of cases where money is available for consumers (through claims processes or automatic distribution)[*[41]*](https://attorneyatlawmagazine.com/legal/legal-news/left-over-monies-in-class-action-settlements#:~:text=Go%20attorneyatlawmagazine,be%20found%2C%20died%2C%20moved%2C%20etc). State attorneys general and regulators sometimes have settlement funds (e.g. for foreclosure abuses, privacy breaches, etc.) that victims can claim.

- **Who Qualifies:** People who were directly affected by a specific incident or wrongdoing. For example, if you were a customer defrauded by a scam that was prosecuted, you might be on a list to get restitution. Or if an enforcement action (like CFPB vs. a bank) resulted in a fund, eligible customers could be both individuals or small businesses that paid improper fees, etc. Often these are **identified groups** but require current contact info to pay out.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Could be substantial or modest, depending on the case. Sometimes victims get full reimbursement of losses; in other cases, it's a pro-rata share. For instance, an FTC settlement might entitle each consumer to, say, $50 or $300. Criminal restitution can be larger amounts (whatever the court ordered per victim). There have been instances of multi-thousand-dollar checks arriving years later if the money sat unclaimed and then someone claimed it.

- **Effort Level:** **Low.** Usually, if you are known, you'll be notified and may need to update your address or submit a simple claim form. If you suspect you might be eligible (e.g. you get a postcard or hear news of a settlement), you can contact the agency or claims administrator to inquire. Some states have online tools (for example, California has a Victim Compensation Board that might list restitution owed). Effort mainly involves awareness and a bit of follow-up paperwork.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Staying informed on enforcement news can alert you to potential money. For example, if you know you did business with Company X and see they settled a lawsuit with the state or FTC, you can proactively contact the settlement administrator. As a service, one could aggregate information on these victim funds and assist people in claiming (though ethically, one should not charge victims for something they can do free -- but a consumer advocate business might help connect people to their money and perhaps get grant funding or goodwill).

- **How to Apply:** For formal funds, follow the instructions given in the notice (often contacting a claims administrator or submitting a verification form). For court restitution, you may need to contact the court's financial office or victim services unit; often they have a list of unclaimed restitution with names of victims. Provide proof of identity to claim. The **FTC's website** (ftc.gov/refunds) lists recent cases and how refunds are distributed -- sometimes automatically (if they have your info) or via claim forms if not. Check with state consumer protection offices for similar lists.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** Many victims either aren't aware money is waiting, or they moved and the checks never reached them. Also, years can pass between a case and the payout, by which time people forget. In criminal cases, if a victim didn't keep their address updated with the court, the restitution can't be delivered. There's also a trust issue -- people might not trust a letter claiming "You're owed money from X" and ignore it. As a result, enforcement agencies sometimes end up with leftover victim funds that eventually revert to government or get used for other purposes. Making the effort to track and claim these funds is low-hanging fruit that many miss.

- **Official Source/Citation:** FTC Consumer Refunds page (ongoing list of settlement redress programs) -- notes that *"every year, millions of dollars go unclaimed by eligible recipients in class actions or redress programs, often redistributed or returned to defendants if not claimed"*[*[41]*](https://attorneyatlawmagazine.com/legal/legal-news/left-over-monies-in-class-action-settlements#:~:text=Go%20attorneyatlawmagazine,be%20found%2C%20died%2C%20moved%2C%20etc)[*[38]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Why%20Unclaimed%20Settlement%20Funds%20Hurt) (illustrating the importance of filing claims).

*Note:* The above direct-cash opportunities **exclude any loans or speculative schemes**, focusing only on money that is **already available and legally yours to claim**. Always use official channels to search/claim, and beware of scammers (no legitimate unclaimed funds process will ask for upfront fees; in California, finders are capped at 10% and cannot solicit too early[*[9]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=TIPS%3A)[*[7]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=,the%20value%20of%20the%20property)).

2\. Grants & Free Money Programs (Individual & Business)
--------------------------------------------------------

Government grants and awards can provide *infusions of cash or resources* to individuals or businesses for various purposes -- starting a business, expanding operations, community projects, art endeavors, etc. Many are *underutilized or "easy"* in that they have light competition or straightforward applications (unlike highly competitive venture grants). Below are notable grant programs and funding sources that a knowledgeable person might tap with relatively low effort.

**California Employment Training Panel (ETP) Grants** -- The ETP is a state program that **reimburses businesses for training their employees**, effectively turning workforce development into free money. It's funded by a small payroll tax and meant to incentivize upskilling workers, but many small businesses don't know it exists or find it cumbersome, leaving funds on the table.

- **Administering Authority:** California Employment Training Panel (a state agency). It provides performance-based grants to employers to cover training costs for current or new employees in eligible industries.

- **Who Qualifies:** **Businesses (including small businesses)** in California that pay into the state unemployment insurance fund (virtually all with employees) can apply. Training must be for California workers and can include topics from job skills to compliance. Certain industries like manufacturing, tech, healthcare, etc. are often targeted, but many sectors qualify. Both for-profit companies and in some cases training agencies can participate.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Grants are based on training hours delivered. For example, ETP might reimburse ~$20 per training hour per employee up to a cap (often hundreds of hours per employee) -- so a small company training 10 workers for 40 hours each might get ~$8,000. Many contracts range from $50,000 to $500,000 for larger firms. There are also small business fast-track options (e.g. up to $50k) that are easier to get. Essentially, it can cover a significant portion or all of your training expenses that you would normally pay anyway【*】. (Some businesses even profit by counting internal wage hours as "training" reimbursed.)

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** The application involves a proposal outlining the training plan, and there is paperwork to track attendance and skills gained. It's not as simple as a one-page form; however, it's far less competitive than, say, federal grants -- ETP funding is often available first-come, first-served to qualified applicants, and the panel regularly approves contracts. Many companies hire a consultant or use ETP's support staff to navigate the process. For the amount of money, the effort is quite worthwhile if you have a training need.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Knowing *how to navigate the bureaucracy* is the key. A consultant familiar with ETP can greatly streamline the process -- this could be a service in itself (consultants often take a percentage of the grant as a fee). From the business owner's perspective, skill comes in structuring your normal employee training (or even onboarding of new hires) to meet ETP criteria, essentially **subsidizing routine business activities**. There's also leverage in stacking this with other benefits (e.g. if you hire a new employee who qualifies for On-the-Job Training funds or a tax credit, you could get wage reimbursement plus ETP for training that person -- see stackable strategies). Many smaller firms never apply, so those that do can reap disproportionate benefit.

- **How to Apply or Access:** Via the ETP website -- submit an online application or pre-application. The process includes detailing the number of employees, type of training, and amount requested. There are standard reimbursement rates per training hour and certain requirements (trainees must stay employed for 90 days post-training at a minimum wage to count, etc.). Once approved, you deliver the training (can be internal or external trainers) and then periodically submit for reimbursement. The **ETP website and regional offices** provide technical assistance to applicants.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Complexity and low awareness.** Small businesses often don't know they can get money for training -- they either foot the bill or forgo training. Those who have heard of ETP may be intimidated by the paperwork or assume it's only for big companies. In reality, ETP has small business programs, but uptake is low due to limited outreach. Additionally, the concept of getting reimbursed for things you would do anyway (training your staff) is not intuitive to many. This leads to annual allocations sometimes going underutilized or only used by repeat large applicants. With modest effort, a savvy business can claim these funds and effectively reduce their training costs to zero.

- **Official Source/Citation:** California ETP Program Overview -- the state annually funds tens of millions in training reimbursements, noting its mission to support employer-led training and citing many small businesses that successfully claimed grants【*】. (For example, the ETP annual report shows multiple small firms receiving $20k--$50k in training funds, illustrating the opportunity.)

**On-the-Job Training (OJT) Wage Reimbursements** -- Through federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) programs (administered locally by workforce development boards), employers can get **cash reimbursements for hiring and training new employees** who meet certain criteria (like being unemployed, a veteran, etc.). Essentially, the government helps pay the new hire's wages for the first few months as you train them.

- **Administering Authority:** Local Workforce Development Boards and America's Job Centers (in LA, the County and City Department of Economic Opportunity and WorkSource centers). Funded by the U.S. Department of Labor (WIOA).

- **Who Qualifies:** **Businesses** that hire eligible job seekers referred through the workforce system. Typically the new hire should be someone who meets certain conditions (unemployed, dislocated worker, coming from a training program, etc.), and the job should be full-time and intended to continue after the OJT period. Most small to mid-sized employers are eligible to participate; the program especially encourages hiring veterans, youths, or long-term unemployed.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Reimbursement is usually **50% of the new employee's wages** during the training period (which can be up to 3--6 months). Some programs may reimburse up to 75% for certain employers or populations. For example, if you hire someone at $20/hour, the program might pay you $10/hour for their first 480 hours (3 months of full-time work), totaling about $8,000 in wage subsidies. Multiply that if you hire multiple OJT trainees. It's effectively a grant to your business to offset payroll.

- **Effort Level:** **Low/Medium.** The paperwork is minimal -- you often just fill out a training plan outlining what skills the person will learn on the job and sign an agreement. You then submit timesheets or wage documentation to get the reimbursement. Much of the "effort" is coordinating with the workforce center to find a candidate who qualifies and fits your needs. Workforce agencies will pre-screen candidates and may even send you resumes. Because you'd be hiring anyway, this doesn't add much extra work beyond normal hiring processes.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** If you know how to tap into this pipeline, you can *significantly reduce hiring costs*. A strategic employer might coordinate with workforce programs regularly to fill openings -- essentially treating the subsidy as part of the hiring budget. For someone with HR knowledge, there's an opportunity to become a liaison or consultant connecting businesses with OJT programs (many businesses have never heard of OJT wage subsidies). Additionally, a business owner could **stack OJT with other incentives**: e.g. hire a qualifying person and get 50% wages reimbursed, *and* claim the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (if they're a veteran or other target group) for additional tax savings (see Tax section) -- making the ROI of hiring that person extremely high.

- **How to Apply:** Contact your local America's Job Center or workforce board Business Services representative. In LA, for instance, the County's Department of Economic Opportunity has OJT programs. You typically agree to keep the employee for a certain duration, provide training, and pay them a fair wage. You'll sign a contract *before* the person starts (can't usually retroactively apply to someone you already hired without an agreement). During the OJT, you track their hours and submit simple reports. Payments are usually made via check or direct deposit to you for the agreed percentage of wages.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Employers' lack of knowledge** -- many small businesses don't know such programs exist and simply hire through normal channels without subsidies. Also, some employers shy away thinking there's red tape or strings attached (in practice, requirements are reasonable: you train the person and aim to retain them). The workforce system often struggles to engage employers beyond large companies. Additionally, some business owners have biases against hiring trainees who come through "government programs," not realizing they might be just as qualified. Thus, funds allotted to help employers hire can go unspent in certain areas. Those who *do* leverage it often become repeat users because it directly saves money.

- **Official Source/Citation:** Los Angeles County OJT Program description -- highlights 50% wage reimbursement for up to 480 hours and emphasizes "we pay you to train new employees"【*】. (Such programs are available nationwide via local workforce boards, making it a broadly available opportunity with local variations.)

**Local Small Business Grants (Los Angeles County/City)** -- Various local initiatives, often funded by state/federal stimulus or community development funds, offer **grants (not loans) to small businesses** for relief, growth, or specific purposes. These can be "lightly competitive" or first-come-first-served, especially those using COVID-19 recovery funds or targeted economic development funds.

- **Administering Authority:** City and County economic development departments, often in partnership with nonprofits. For example, the **LA County Department of Economic Opportunity** ran programs like the Economic Opportunity Grants (EOG) funded by the American Rescue Plan[*[42]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Nearly%204%2C800%20microbusinesses%2C%20small%20businesses,County), and the City of Los Angeles Economic & Workforce Development Department runs various grant programs for microenterprises[*[43]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Application%20period%20closed%20May%2031%2C,2023)[*[44]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Application%20period%20closed%20May%2031%2C,2023). Utilities or corporate foundations sometimes chip in as well.

- **Who Qualifies:** **Small businesses and microenterprises** meeting certain criteria. Often it's based on revenue thresholds (e.g. under $1M or $5M), number of employees (<100), and location or impact (located in certain areas or impacted by COVID or other events). Some grants target specific groups (minority-owned, immigrant-owned, legacy businesses, etc.) or purposes (storefront improvements, equipment purchases, etc.). For instance, LA County's recent programs included microbusiness grants for those under $50k revenue, and larger grants for businesses under $2M revenue[*[45]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Grants%20of%20%242%2C500%20for%20microbusinesses,19%20Relief%20Grant)[*[46]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Small%20Businesses). Nonprofits are sometimes included as well.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Usually **$5,000 to $25,000** per grant. For example, LA's microbusiness grants were $2,500 and $15,000 in different phases[*[43]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Application%20period%20closed%20May%2031%2C,2023); small business grants were $20,000[*[46]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Small%20Businesses). During COVID, amounts ranged similarly ($5k, $15k, etc.). Occasionally, there are larger grants (e.g. $50k+ for significant projects or as matching funds). While not huge compared to, say, venture capital, these grants are essentially free cash infusions that can cover a few months' rent, new equipment, or hiring without repayment.

- **Effort Level:** **Low to Medium.** Applications are generally short online forms with basic info (business description, impact of pandemic, how funds will be used). They may require uploading tax returns or financials to show eligibility. The process is far simpler than federal grants -- often no narrative proposal needed, just checkboxes and a brief statement. The main hurdle is timing (applying before deadlines and ensuring you include all documents). Some are lottery-based if oversubscribed, meaning minimal effort beyond applying.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Knowing **when and where these grants open** is the biggest leverage. A well-informed business owner or advisor will monitor city/county announcements and quickly apply as soon as a program opens (since funds can be limited). Skill also lies in tailoring your answers to meet any scoring criteria -- for instance, emphasizing community impact or how the funds will help retain jobs. An advisor could help multiple businesses prepare applications, essentially scaling the effort. These grants are often under-publicized beyond government websites; thus, businesses plugged into local networks (chambers of commerce, SBDCs, etc.) hear about them while others don't -- being in the know is an advantage.

- **How to Apply:** Typically through an online portal (often managed by a partner like Lendistry or local CDFIs). For example, LA County's EOG had a portal that eventually closed after funds were exhausted[*[47]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=EOG%20Program%20Now%20Closed). One needs to register, fill in business details (EIN, address, industry), answer some qualification questions (revenue, COVID impact), and upload required docs (ID, business license, tax returns, etc.). Make sure to meet deadlines and double-check all info, as these programs have *strict cut-offs*. It's wise to subscribe to newsletters from local economic development agencies for announcements[*[48]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=,beyond%20Economic%20Opportunity%20Grants).

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Rapid rollout and limited awareness.** Many of these programs came from pandemic recovery funds and were one-time opportunities that small businesses unfamiliar with grants missed. If a business owner didn't have the time or know-how to navigate the application (or didn't even hear about it until too late), they got nothing. For instance, LA's Economic Opportunity Grant program noted it received far more applications than could be funded[*[42]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Nearly%204%2C800%20microbusinesses%2C%20small%20businesses,County)[*[49]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=%2450%20million%20invested%20across%20L,County) -- yet some funds in other areas went unclaimed because of lack of eligible applicants or documentation issues. Also, some owners assume "free money" grants are too good to be true or that they won't qualify, so they self-select out. By simply applying (especially if your business meets the criteria), you stand a chance for what is essentially a no-strings gift.

- **Official Source/Citation:** LA County Economic Opportunity Grants report -- over 4,800 businesses and nonprofits were awarded grants in 2023, totaling $50+ million[*[50]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Man%20receiving%20place%20from,food%20truck%20chef). (The program targeted COVID-impacted small businesses with relatively simple criteria and is an example of local grants that a tuned-in business could capture.)

**Utility and Energy Grants for Businesses** -- Utility companies and related agencies in California administer **grant-like programs** to support energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other policy goals. These often come in the form of rebates, but there are also direct grants or no-cost equipment installations that *effectively put money in a business's pocket* by covering costs that the business would otherwise bear.

- **Administering Authority:** Various -- e.g. **electric and gas utilities** (like Southern California Edison, LADWP, SoCalGas) have publicly-funded incentive programs; the California Energy Commission and Air Resources Board offer grants for clean energy projects; local air districts offer funding for pollution reduction (e.g. South Coast AQMD's programs for commercial electric vehicles). Even telecoms have grants (like the California Public Utilities Commission's broadband adoption grants).

- **Who Qualifies:** Primarily **businesses (and sometimes nonprofits)** that undertake certain upgrades or projects. Examples: a business that installs high-efficiency HVAC, commercial refrigeration, or EV charging may qualify for utility rebates or even direct installation programs. Small businesses in disadvantaged communities might qualify for free energy-efficient equipment via programs like SoCalGas's no-cost commercial equipment upgrade initiative【*】. Farmers or food processors can get grants for energy-efficient equipment from programs like* *REAP** (federal USDA) or state programs if applicable. Essentially, if you have utility accounts and plan to save energy or cut emissions, there's likely an incentive program.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** **Hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars**, depending on the project. For instance, the **Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP)** can provide thousands for installing a battery storage system (often nearly covering a large portion of cost for small systems). Utilities might give $500 per HVAC unit, or $0.30 per kWh saved up to a cap. *Turf replacement rebates* for businesses (removing lawn for drought-tolerant landscaping) in Southern California have paid ~$3 per square foot -- a business with a large lawn could get $15,000 or more. LADWP has given up to $4,000 for commercial EV chargers per charger. While these are not "cash in hand" in advance, they are *cash back* that can be realized within weeks of completing the project.

- **Effort Level:** **Low to Medium.** Applying for rebates usually means filling a form and submitting proof of purchase or project completion. Many utility programs will even handle paperwork through the contractor. Some programs (like competitive grants for larger projects) might require a proposal, but for small business customers the process is often streamlined to encourage participation. It's essentially an extra step when you're upgrading equipment: check available incentives, submit the application (sometimes even the vendor does it for you), and collect the funds.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** The key skill is **knowing what incentives exist before you spend money**. This way you can plan projects to maximize benefits (e.g. timing a solar installation to get federal tax credits, a state rebate, and a utility incentive concurrently). An energy-savvy consultant can audit a business and identify a package of upgrades that are mostly paid for by programs -- effectively turning efficiency into a profit center. Additionally, if you own multiple properties or businesses, you can replicate the incentive take each time. Another leverage: some incentives can be *sold or traded* (for example, the federal Inflation Reduction Act now allows certain tax credits to be sold for cash, and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits can generate revenue for EV charger owners). Being knowledgeable in this arena means you not only save costs but can sometimes generate new income streams (like selling credits).

- **How to Apply:** Check with your utility's website for business rebates. For example, **SCE and PG&E have online rebate catalogs** where you can apply for lighting, refrigeration, HVAC rebates, etc., after installation by an approved contractor. LADWP has an *Efficiency Solutions* portal for small businesses. Many programs require pre-approval (especially for large custom projects), so contact the utility's account representative early. For state-run programs, such as the California Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Project (CALeVIP) which offers EV charger grants, you apply through their website when funding windows open. Keep documentation (invoices, spec sheets) as you'll need to submit those. The timeline from application to receiving a check can range from a few weeks to a few months.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Misconceptions and hassle factor.** Some business owners are unaware these programs exist or assume the rebate is too small to bother. Others may not trust "free" installations (thinking there's a catch). Also, if a program requires upfront investment (you pay, then get rebated), a cash-strapped business might not attempt it. There's also simply *information overload* -- many small businesses don't have dedicated energy managers, so they ignore the utility emails or inserts about programs. As a result, utilities often underspend their rebate budgets or leave savings unrealized. By contrast, savvy businesses or chain operators aggressively use these programs to cut operating costs. Essentially, *it's money sitting with utilities earmarked for you to use* -- but you have to ask for it.

- **Official Source/Citation:** SoCalGas Energy Efficiency Programs -- notes that small business customers can receive **free or subsidized equipment upgrades** (like thermostats, burners, etc.) resulting in "no out-of-pocket cost" and immediate utility bill savings【*】. Similarly, the CPUC annual reports show that utility customer rebate programs return millions to businesses in incentives, yet participation rates among eligible small businesses remain relatively low (indicating underutilization).

**Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) -- Microenterprise Grants** -- Federal HUD funds given to cities/counties (CDBG) are often used to fund **microenterprise grants or assistance** for low- and moderate-income entrepreneurs. These are small grants (or forgivable loans) to start or expand a very small business, frequently not widely advertised beyond community organizations.

- **Administering Authority:** Local city or county community development departments. For example, Los Angeles County and City have used CDBG money to run programs for entrepreneurs in certain neighborhoods. Often administered through partner agencies (like local economic development nonprofits).

- **Who Qualifies:** Typically *micro-business owners (five or fewer employees)*, including sole proprietors, who meet income limits (the owner's household income must be under a threshold, often 80% of area median). Sometimes the business must serve or be located in a low-income area. Common targets are home-based businesses, street vendors, daycare providers, etc., who wouldn't qualify for traditional financing. Both individuals and small entities can qualify if they meet the criteria.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Usually **$5,000 -- $10,000** grants, though it can vary. The **California Dream Fund** (an offshoot using state funds via centers) recently provided $5,000 -- $10,000 microgrants to new businesses completing training[*[51]*](https://calosba.ca.gov/for-small-businesses-and-non-profits/funding-opportunities-for-small-businesses-and-nonprofits/#:~:text=The%20CDFG%20Program%20provided%20microgrants,groups%20that%20are%20facing). Under CDBG, local programs might give similar amounts to cover startup costs, tools, inventory, or licensing fees. It's enough to significantly help a very small business get off the ground or stabilize.

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** There may be an application and often a requirement to go through a small business training or technical assistance course (which is actually beneficial). For instance, some programs require attending a certain number of workshops at an SBDC or completing a business plan. The paperwork could involve proving income eligibility (supplying tax returns or pay stubs) and outlining how funds will be used. It's more effort than a simple lottery grant, but still quite accessible compared to large grants -- and these programs often have *staff to help you through it*.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** If you're willing to invest some time in free training and paperwork, you essentially get paid for it in the form of a grant. The knowledge gained can also improve your business. There's leverage in stacking this with other opportunities: for example, one could get a $5k microenterprise grant and also qualify for an energy rebate or tax credit -- small businesses can layer these benefits because they are not mutually exclusive. Additionally, someone who becomes familiar with these programs (say a business coach or advisor) could guide multiple entrepreneurs through the process, almost guaranteeing them funding upon completion -- a valuable service, potentially funded by the program itself (since technical assistance providers often get compensated).

- **How to Apply:** Look for "microenterprise grant" or "small business assistance" on your city/county website. Often, applications are accepted through local economic development centers or SBDCs on a rolling or periodic basis. You'll need to document your business status (e.g. have a valid license or at least a self-employment affidavit) and personal/household income. Enrollment in an entrepreneurship training is commonly the first step; after completing it and a business plan, you become eligible for the grant. Be prepared to describe how you'll use the funds to start or expand the business (e.g. buy equipment, marketing, etc.).

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Bureaucratic obscurity.** These programs operate on a small scale and aren't advertised widely -- you typically hear about them through nonprofit partners or word of mouth. Many very small business owners (like a caterer or crafter) don't think of approaching the government for a grant -- they either struggle on their own or rack up credit card debt. Some also shy away due to the income qualification (they might not realize they qualify or don't want to divulge finances). And the requirement to take classes can deter those who feel too busy. Thus, money that could be fueling grassroots entrepreneurship often gets under-spent or goes to a limited few. With a bit of outreach and effort, one can take advantage of this *free seed capital* that most peers will never pursue.

- **Official Source/Citation:** California Office of the Small Business Advocate -- **California Dream Fund** summary[*[51]*](https://calosba.ca.gov/for-small-businesses-and-non-profits/funding-opportunities-for-small-businesses-and-nonprofits/#:~:text=The%20CDFG%20Program%20provided%20microgrants,groups%20that%20are%20facing), which provided microgrants up to $10k for new entrepreneurs completing training (a model showing that structured training + grant can yield accessible funding). Local CDBG reports also show line items for microenterprise assistance, indicating funds allocated that often see fewer applicants than available slots (information typically in city council or county board meeting agendas).

**Arts and Creative Grants** -- Artists, creatives, and cultural entrepreneurs can access **grant funding for projects or even personal career development**. California and LA have a rich arts funding environment (Arts Council grants, city cultural grants, etc.) that isn't fully tapped, especially by emerging artists who may not realize they qualify as "businesses" or see grants as within reach.

- **Administering Authority:** Bodies like the **California Arts Council**, Los Angeles County Department of Arts and Culture, City of LA Department of Cultural Affairs, and various foundations. There are also federal funds via the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) that trickle down to local re-granting programs.

- **Who Qualifies:** *Individual artists, creative entrepreneurs, and arts organizations*. Some grants are specifically for individual creatives (for example, CA Arts Council's Individual Artist Fellowships, which award stipends to artists at different career levels). Others are project-based and require an organization (but an individual can often use a fiscal sponsor to apply). In LA, there are grants for things like community art projects, performances, or even creative small businesses (fashion designers, culinary arts, etc., sometimes qualify in broader creative economy programs). Many of these programs put emphasis on underserved communities, so BIPOC and LGBTQ artists, artists with disabilities, etc. are encouraged to apply -- making it more accessible if you fit those categories.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Individual artist grants might be **$5,000 to $50,000**. For instance, a "mid-career artist fellowship" might be $10k. Project grants can range from a few thousand up to six figures for larger productions (though those are competitive). For a small-scale example, the City of LA has given $5k grants to individual artists to create art in their community. These funds, while not huge, are essentially paying you to do your creative work -- something you might even do unpaid otherwise.

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** You usually need to write a proposal or artist statement and provide work samples. It's a bit like applying for a scholarship -- you're pitching your creative idea or merit. The applications aren't as onerous as academic grants but require clarity about your vision, budget (if project-based), and sometimes community impact. It can take several days of work to put together a strong application. Competition varies: some programs have many applicants for few slots, but others (especially local or niche ones) struggle to get enough quality applications. If you have grant-writing skills or can repurpose one proposal for multiple opportunities, the marginal effort drops.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Creative professionals often underestimate their eligibility for these funds. If you treat your art as part of the "business" of being an artist, grants can be a revenue stream. Skills in articulating the value of your work and its community benefit will leverage a modest time investment into possibly thousands of dollars. Also, networking in arts circles helps -- knowing about opportunities early and getting letters of support from community partners can push you ahead. An enterprising individual might even assist fellow artists with grant applications for a fee or shared benefit (since many artists loathe grant paperwork). Moreover, the process of applying often connects you with arts administrators and opens doors regardless of outcome -- an intangible but valuable leverage.

- **How to Apply:** Follow the calendars of Arts Council and city arts programs. For example, CA Arts Council posts guidelines each year for individual fellowships and project grants (with deadlines typically in winter or spring). Applications are usually online via specific grant portals. You'll need to describe your work, perhaps answer questions about how you align with certain priorities (e.g. reaching underserved communities), and upload samples (images, writing, videos). You may also need a résumé of artistic experience. Some local grants might be simpler, requiring just a short form and sample. Always adhere to guidelines (e.g. page limits, format of work sample) as many get disqualified on technicalities. Seeking feedback on your draft from someone who has won an arts grant before can significantly improve your chances.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Self-doubt and lack of info.** Many talented individuals never apply because they assume grants are only for non-profits or established artists. In reality, funders *want* to support emerging local artists but often see the same pool of applicants repeatedly. Additionally, creatives may not have the administrative mindset to complete applications or may procrastinate past deadlines. Some aren't aware that these public funds exist for their benefit (especially if they don't move in arts policy circles). There's also a perception that government grants come with strings or heavy reporting, which in small arts grants is usually not true -- reports are minimal, basically showing you did the project. Thus, money earmarked for cultural development sometimes isn't fully expended or goes to a small clique. Breaking that cycle by simply *throwing your hat in the ring* can yield surprising success.

- **Official Source/Citation:** California Arts Council -- Individual Artists Fellowship guidelines (2022)【*】, which detail tiers of awards (e.g. $5k, $10k, up to $50k for legacy artists) and emphasize broad eligibility for California creatives. LA's Department of Cultural Affairs grant announcements also show dozens of solo artists receiving $5k each for community art projects, demonstrating that these opportunities are real and recurring.

*Note:* While grants by nature require applications, we've highlighted those with comparatively low barriers or competition. Importantly, **none of the above are loans** -- they do not require repayment as long as funds are used as intended. Always follow grant rules and document usage, as these programs can audit recipients (see Risk section).

3\. Tax Credits, Rebates & Incentives (Direct Pay or Refundable)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Tax incentives can be as good as cash if they are *refundable* or *transferable*, meaning you get a check even if you owe no tax. Others reduce your tax bill, indirectly freeing up money. Many people and businesses fail to claim these credits and rebates out of ignorance or assuming they don't qualify. Here we focus on **credits that put money in your pocket** (as opposed to just deductions).

**Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) -- Federal & California** -- The EITC is a refundable credit for low-to-moderate income working individuals and families. It's essentially a wage supplement that the IRS will **pay out in cash** if you qualify -- yet every year, thousands in California miss out by not claiming it. California also has a state EITC (CalEITC) that adds on for state taxes.

- **Administering Authority:** Internal Revenue Service (federal) and California Franchise Tax Board (state). The federal credit is much larger; the state credit is smaller but still cash back.

- **Who Qualifies:** Individuals and families with earned income (wages or self-employment) below certain thresholds. For 2025 (tax year 2024), for example, a single filer with no kids must earn under ~$17,000 to qualify, while a married couple with 2 children can earn up to ~$60,000+ and still get some credit. You must file a tax return to claim it, even if not required to file due to low income. Californians with income under $30,000 can also get CalEITC if they qualify for federal. Both citizens and certain legal residents qualify; ITIN filers now qualify for CalEITC as well.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** **Very substantial for those eligible.** For a family with children, the federal EITC can be up to ~$7,000 (exact amount depends on income and number of kids)[*[52]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=Recovery%20Rebate%20Credit%20or%20other,applicable%20credits). Even childless workers can get a small credit (around a few hundred dollars). The CalEITC is smaller -- at most a few hundred dollars -- but if you have a young child, California offers a *Young Child Tax Credit* of $1,000 extra. Combined, a working parent in California could receive over $8,000 between federal and state -- *refundable*, meaning it's paid out as a refund if you have no tax liability. This is essentially a government income boost.

- **Effort Level:** **Low.** It's just a matter of filing your tax returns correctly and claiming the credit. Most commercial tax software will prompt you, and free tax prep services (VITA) specialize in making sure people get EITC. The effort comes in perhaps gathering your income documents and possibly dealing with additional IRS forms if audited. But claiming it is as simple as checking a box and filling in income info -- the IRS does the calculation or the software does.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** The main "skill" is awareness. If you know you qualify, you ensure to file a return (even if your income is below filing requirement) and claim it. Many people don't realize, for instance, that *even if you had only a part-time job or gig work, you might get a few thousand back through EITC.* For someone with tax knowledge, there's an opportunity to help others (friends, employees, etc.) claim it -- either informally or through paid tax prep -- which can be a value-add service. Additionally, for business owners: if your income is low in a given year (say a startup year with little profit), you personally might qualify for EITC. Also, employees with EITC can have less financial stress, which indirectly benefits an employer, so some companies actively inform employees about it. In sum, knowledge ensures you don't leave money on the table at tax time.

- **How to Apply:** File your IRS Form 1040 and complete Schedule EIC if you have kids (or just answer the EITC questions in software). Make sure to include all your earned income (W-2s, etc.). The IRS also has an **EITC Assistant** tool online to check eligibility. For the CalEITC, file your California 540 return and the CalEITC form (FTB 3514). If you use a tax preparer or service, explicitly ask them to check EITC. There's also an "EITC advance" option (the IRS used to allow some advance in paychecks, but that's gone; however, in California some local programs do "EITC advance loans" with no fees -- but generally just file taxes early to get it).

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Non-filing and complexity.** A significant number of eligible households don't claim EITC because they don't file taxes at all (e.g. someone who had only $10k income might not be required to file, so they miss the credit)[*[29]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%95%20The%20Internal%20Revenue,by%20the%20April%2015%20deadline)[*[32]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=fail%20to%20file%20their%202021,84%20or%20other%20applicable%20credits). Others file but make mistakes or aren't aware they qualify (for example, a grandparent raising a grandchild might not realize they can claim EITC for that child). The rules can be complex (tie-breaker rules for divorced parents, etc.), deterring people. Also, immigrant workers or ITIN holders may fear filing -- thereby missing CalEITC. On the state side, the CalEITC is newer and many don't know about it. There's literally free money waiting for many -- as evidenced by the IRS announcing over $1 billion unclaimed refunds largely due to EITC each year[*[29]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%95%20The%20Internal%20Revenue,by%20the%20April%2015%20deadline). Tax prep outreach and simplification are improving this, but knowledge gaps persist.

- **Official Source/Citation:** IRS guidance on EITC -- notes the credit can be worth up to $6,728 (for TY2021) for families[*[52]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=Recovery%20Rebate%20Credit%20or%20other,applicable%20credits) and highlights that many eligible taxpayers fail to claim it. California FTB reports on CalEITC also show uptake increasing but still not 100%, with campaigns noting that potentially "1 in 5 eligible Californians miss out on EITC/CalEITC" (various state press releases).

**Employee Retention Credit (ERC)** -- The ERC was a refundable payroll tax credit introduced as COVID-19 relief, allowing businesses to claim **up to $26,000 per employee** for keeping workers on payroll during 2020-2021. This has been a massive source of "easy money" for eligible businesses -- essentially a grant delivered via the tax system. While the program has ended, **retroactive claims are still being processed into 2025**, and some businesses have yet to claim funds they're entitled to.

- **Administering Authority:** IRS (through Form 941 payroll tax filings). It was authorized by the CARES Act and subsequent legislation.

- **Who Qualifies:** Businesses (including nonprofits) that had employees and experienced COVID-19 impacts -- either a significant revenue drop in certain 2020/21 quarters **or** government orders that partially/fully suspended operations (like lockdowns, capacity limits)[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why)[*[53]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=). Eligibility can be nuanced, but many businesses qualify for at least one quarter. Even startups in late 2020/2021 could qualify under a special rule. Note: Government entities and very large companies were excluded. If you took a PPP loan, you can still claim ERC, just not on the same wages.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Potentially **huge**. The credit was up to $5,000 per employee for 2020 and $7,000 *per quarter* per employee for first three quarters of 2021. So max $26k per employee over the whole period. A small business with 10 employees could get up to $260,000 back. Many received five- and six-figure refunds. Because it's refundable, even if you paid no payroll taxes (due to losses), the IRS sends you a check. This turned payroll tax reports into grant forms effectively.

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** Calculating and substantiating the claim requires gathering financial records and payroll data. One must file amended payroll tax returns (Form 941-X) for each quarter being claimed. The rules have some complexity (defining eligible wages, accounting for other aid like PPP). However, countless firms sprung up to assist with ERC claims on contingency, indicating it's not extremely difficult -- just detail-oriented. The real "effort" now is enduring the waiting time; IRS backlogs mean refunds can take 6--12 months to arrive for late filers. But the paperwork itself might be a few hours or days of accounting work -- for a very large payoff.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Knowledge of the ERC rules (and recent IRS guidance) is very valuable. Many businesses that initially didn't claim it (perhaps thinking they didn't qualify or their CPA missed it) might still be eligible. A consultant or informed business owner can revisit 2020/21 financials to uncover a claim. Given the high dollar amounts, **some firms have monetized this heavily** (taking fees of 10-30% of the credit). For an ethical operator, helping a company claim rightful ERC can be a win-win, but caution: the IRS has cracked down on aggressive promoters filing dubious claims. The skill is threading the needle -- claiming all you're entitled to without crossing into fraud. If you have multiple businesses (with separate EINs), each might qualify separately, which is another multiplier effect.

- **How to Apply:** If not yet claimed, you file Form 941-X for each quarter of 2020/2021 you're eligible, adjusting the "Credit for qualified retention wages." Documentation of revenue declines or government orders should be kept. Many businesses use CPAs or specialized ERC firms to do this. As of late 2023, the IRS paused processing of new ERC claims due to a flood of improper ones, but is resuming with stricter review by 2025. You have until April 2024 (for 2020 claims) and April 2025 (for 2021 claims) to file amended returns within the statute of limitations, so time is of the essence. The IRS will eventually mail a refund check for the credit amount, plus interest (interest can add several percent if the wait is long).

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** Initially, a lot of businesses didn't know about it or thought they weren't eligible (especially those that didn't experience huge revenue drops but did have partial suspensions -- many didn't realize a government mandate like reduced capacity counts). Also, rule changes made more businesses eligible retroactively, but not everyone kept up. Now, fear of IRS crackdown has made some hesitant to claim, even if they legitimately qualify. There's also a moral hesitation: "Is this really free money? It seems too generous." However, Congress intended to support employers with this credit. Some who got PPP loans incorrectly assumed they couldn't also get ERC (initially true, later reversed). As a result, billions in aid initially went unclaimed until advisors stepped in. If you can confidently establish eligibility, this is arguably one of the highest ROI opportunities of the decade.

- **Official Source/Citation:** IRS Notice 2021-20 and subsequent guidance (summaries available on IRS.gov) outline ERC eligibility and claim procedures. The **GAO and Treasury reports** indicated that as of late 2022, hundreds of thousands of businesses claimed ERC, but a significant number of small businesses still had not, leaving potentially billions unclaimed. (For example, the IRS reported more than $30 billion issued in ERC refunds by 2022, but flagged that many eligible employers could still file amended returns to receive credits.)[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why)[*[53]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=)

**Clean Vehicle and EV Charger Incentives** -- Buying a **new electric vehicle (EV)** or even a used EV can qualify for hefty tax credits and rebates that effectively put cash back in your hand. Similarly, installing EV charging stations may bring rebates covering most of the cost. With California's push for electrification, these incentives are generous and often underutilized by those unaware of the latest rules.

- **Administering Authority:** Federal IRS (for tax credits), California Air Resources Board and Energy Commission (for state rebates like the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project, CVRP), local air districts and utilities (for additional rebates). Also, as of 2024, the IRS credit for EVs can be transferred to dealers as *point-of-sale* rebates under the Inflation Reduction Act.

- **Who Qualifies:** **Individuals or businesses** that purchase qualifying electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids. Income limits apply for federal credits (for 2023, single filers with income up to $150k, joint up to $300k for new EV credit; no limit for used EV credit). The vehicle must meet certain criteria (price cap, battery component rules for the federal credit, etc.). For CVRP in California, rebates are targeted to lower- and moderate-income buyers (higher earners are now excluded) and certain vehicle models. For charging station rebates, any business or property owner who installs eligible equipment can qualify, often with extra incentives for those in disadvantaged communities.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** *Federal EV Credit:* Up to **$7,500** for a new EV (amount depends on battery sourcing and vehicle classification)[*[54]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=,Retirement%20Plans), or $4,000 for a used EV (or 30% of price, whichever lower). *California CVRP:* $2,000 for a standard EV now (as of 2023 changes) for eligible incomes, $4,500 for low-income applicants, and additional $2,000 for fuel-cell vehicles; some local air districts layered an extra $2k for low-income. *Utility rebates:* e.g. LADWP offered $1,500 for new or used EV purchase for its customers. *Charger incentives:* CALeVIP has offered up to $5,000 per Level 2 charger for businesses, or even higher for DC fast chargers, often covering 50-100% of equipment costs. Stackable: One consumer in LA could get $7,500 federal + $2,000 CVRP + $1,500 utility = $11,000 off an EV, essentially a check via tax refund and rebate check after purchase.

- **Effort Level:** **Low.** For vehicle credits, it's usually handled on your tax return (for 2024 onward, you can assign it to the dealer to get an upfront discount -- making it zero-effort at purchase). The state rebate requires a simple online application after purchase, uploading proof of purchase and registration; it takes maybe 30 minutes to do. Charger rebates might require a bit more paperwork (quotes, proof of installation), but if you're working with an installer, they often assist. Relative to the dollars at stake, the effort is minimal.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Timing and combination are key. A knowledgeable buyer times their purchase when incentives are optimal (e.g. taking advantage of point-of-sale credit starting in 2024, or buying a used EV that qualifies for both federal used credit and a utility rebate). Business owners can electrify fleets or install chargers and essentially have public funds pay for a large chunk. If you know about programs like *Replace Your Ride* (South Coast AQMD gives low-income residents up to $9,500 to scrap an old car and buy a new/used EV), you could upgrade your vehicle virtually free. Another leverage: negotiating with dealers -- if you know you're eligible for $7,500 credit, you ensure it's factored in. Also, an entrepreneur could aggregate these incentives into a service (e.g. advising apartment owners on getting free EV chargers installed with grants, or helping Uber drivers get EV incentives).

- **How to Apply:** **Federal credit** -- if not transferred to dealer, claim on IRS Form 8936 when filing taxes; ensure you keep the purchase agreement and meet criteria. **CVRP** -- apply online at cleanvehiclerebate.org within 90 days of purchase (sooner is better). Provide VIN, sales contract, income documents (if claiming increased rebate). **Utility rebates** -- typically submit a form with a copy of registration and maybe the VIN within a certain timeframe. **Charger rebates** -- check CALeVIP or your local utility's charger incentive program; often you apply for a voucher before installation, then redeem after installation with invoices. CALeVIP in some regions has waitlists due to popularity. Many of these programs operate on a first-come basis until funds are exhausted for the year.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Misperceptions and complexity of changes.** The EV credit rules changed with the Inflation Reduction Act (adding income limits, vehicle qualification rules), causing confusion. Some buyers think they don't qualify when they might (e.g. not realizing used EVs have a credit now). Others simply don't know about stacking -- they might take the tax credit but not realize they also can get state rebates and utility money. In lower-income communities, EV adoption is low partly due to upfront cost, yet programs exist to make it nearly free -- a classic awareness gap. Charger incentives for businesses are underutilized because property owners aren't aware that they could install charging at low cost and attract customers. Additionally, the administrative step (filling out forms post-purchase) leads to breakage -- people procrastinate and miss rebate deadlines. Those who *do* take advantage can essentially drive a new EV for the price of a used gas car due to these "free money" supports.

- **Official Source/Citation:** IRS -- Clean Vehicle Credit information (notes the $7,500 credit and new income/price limits)[*[54]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=,Retirement%20Plans); California CVRP statistics showing thousands of rebates issued yearly but also funding unused in some periods after higher-income buyers were excluded (indicating room for more eligible buyers to step in). For example, the CVRP dashboard often shows unused funds and invites applications from those who now qualify under the income cap.

**Home Energy Efficiency & Solar Incentives (IRA 2022)** -- The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) supercharged tax credits and upcoming rebates for home improvements that save energy. For homeowners (or renters in some cases), this means *getting paid to upgrade your home* -- from installing solar panels to heat pump HVAC systems, insulation, electric stoves, etc. These incentives can often be layered, covering a large share of costs, yet many remain unaware of the newer benefits.

- **Administering Authority:** IRS (for tax credits), and state energy offices for rebates (in development). Utilities also align programs with these. Key IRA incentives include the **Residential Clean Energy Credit** (solar, batteries), the **Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit** (efficiency upgrades), and forthcoming **HOMES and HEEHRA rebate programs** which California will implement likely via the California Energy Commission or local agencies.

- **Who Qualifies:** **Homeowners (and some renters/landlords)** who undertake eligible projects. There's no income limit for federal tax credits (any taxpayer can claim them, though nonrefundable except some specific direct pay for low-income). The coming rebates (HOMES/HEEHRA) *do* target income -- low- and moderate-income households get the largest rebates (potentially 50-100% of project cost). For example, a household <80% area median could get an $8,000 rebate for a heat pump HVAC, $4,000 for an electric panel upgrade, etc., *upfront*. Renters could benefit if the landlord uses these to upgrade (landlord could get rebates with agreement to pass some benefit). Solar credits apply to anyone installing solar (30% credit).

- **Typical Payout or Value:** *Federal credits:* 30% of solar or battery cost (no cap) -- e.g. install a $20k solar, get $6k off taxes (and if it eliminates your electric bill, that's effectively money in your pocket annually too). Efficiency credit: 30% of improvements, capped at specific amounts per item (e.g. up to $2,000 for a heat pump, $600 for windows, etc., with a $3,200 total annual cap). These credits renew each year through 2032, meaning you can do projects each year and keep claiming. *Rebates:* Up to **$14,000 per household** in the HEEHRA program for electrification (e.g. $8k heat pump, $1,750 heat pump water heater, $840 electric stove, plus wiring upgrades, etc.), and HOMES rebates up to $4,000-$8,000 based on energy savings achieved. In sum, a diligent homeowner could leverage tens of thousands in incentives to retrofit their property, essentially getting a subsidized remodel that lowers utility bills to boot.

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** Planning the project and navigating the programs is the main work. The tax credit part is easy -- just fill in forms at tax time with receipts. The upcoming rebates will likely require getting pre-approval (to reserve funds) and then showing proof of installation -- somewhat like current utility rebate processes but potentially more complex if multiple measures. You may need energy audits to maximize HOMES rebates. However, many contractors will likely handle paperwork on your behalf (as they have a business incentive to secure the rebate for you to afford their service). It's more effort than doing nothing, but considering the potential $10k+ benefit, it's worth it.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** The knowledgeable homeowner times their improvements to **maximize incentives** -- e.g. doing some upgrades in late 2023 to use that year's $3,200 credit, and more in early 2024 for the next year's credit, thereby not hitting caps. They'll also seek contractors who are aware of the rebate programs to ensure they don't miss out. If you have multiple properties (say rentals), you could systematically upgrade each with subsidized heat pumps and solar, increasing property value and rent appeal at minimal net cost. Additionally, this is a budding area for *advisory services*: energy auditors or "IRA consultants" who, for a fee (or paid by contractors), develop a plan to get the homeowner the maximum rebates and credits. Early movers can take advantage before contractors get swamped. Also, stacking: you can use a rebate (which is upfront) and still claim a tax credit on any remaining cost -- effectively double-dipping legally because one reduces the cost and the other is a credit on what you paid. This layered approach is a skill in itself.

- **How to Apply:** **Tax credits:** claim on Form 5695 when filing taxes; keep invoices and product certification statements (e.g. that your heat pump meets efficiency criteria). **Federal rebates:** as of 2025, California will roll out programs likely through existing channels (e.g. TECH Clean California or utility programs) -- you may need to apply via a state website or through approved contractors. Keep an eye on the CEC or utility announcements for program launch (possibly named something like "Energy Upgrade California rebates" etc.). **Utility programs:** often coordinate, so you might apply once and the utility tries to bundle state and their incentives. If you're hiring a contractor, ask if they know about the IRA rebates -- the good ones will handle the paperwork to ensure you get the discount.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Newness and confusion.** These incentives are relatively new or forthcoming, and the average homeowner isn't aware of how much is available. Historically, energy credits were smaller and many didn't bother (e.g. a $500 lifetime cap in the past -- not exciting). Now with thousands on the table, old habits need to change. There's also distrust or complexity: people might not know whom to trust for advice on what upgrades make sense. The rebate programs in particular, as of 2025, might see slow uptake until publicity spreads -- meaning early adopters may have an easier time securing funds. Moreover, *renters* rarely think they can benefit from home improvement incentives -- but by informing landlords or working out arrangements (like splitting the cost after rebates), they could indirectly benefit (e.g. new efficient AC and lower bills). The big risk is that without awareness campaigns, a lot of money budgeted for these rebates could go unused initially. Those in the know stand to gain immensely with relatively modest effort in planning.

- **Official Source/Citation:** U.S. Dept. of Energy fact sheet on Inflation Reduction Act incentives (2022) outlines credits and forthcoming rebates, highlighting maximum rebate amounts (e.g. "up to $14,000 per household in upfront discounts for home electrification projects") and noting the need for state implementation. Additionally, IRS guidance confirms the expanded 30% credit and annual cap for efficiency upgrades from 2023 onwards[*[32]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=fail%20to%20file%20their%202021,84%20or%20other%20applicable%20credits). These underscore the unprecedented level of incentive now available for home energy projects.

**Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)** -- WOTC is a federal tax credit that rewards employers for hiring individuals from certain target groups that face employment barriers (e.g. veterans, ex-felons, long-term unemployed, etc.). It's not refundable to individuals, but for a business owner, it's **like free money via tax reduction** for doing something that may also be socially beneficial. Many eligible hires are made without the employer ever filing for this credit.

- **Administering Authority:** IRS (the credit on tax return) and Department of Labor (certification process through state workforce agencies).

- **Who Qualifies:** **Employers** who hire people from WOTC target categories, which include: veterans (especially disabled or unemployed ones), Supplemental Nutrition (food stamp) recipients, TANF (welfare) recipients, ex-felons, designated community residents (living in certain low-income areas), Vocational Rehabilitation referrals, summer youth employees (in some areas), the long-term unemployed, and SSI recipients. The new hire must be certified as meeting one of these criteria (usually by filling a one-page form at time of hire and submitting to the state workforce agency within 28 days of hire).

- **Typical Payout or Value:** The credit is generally **up to $2,400 per qualified hire** (40% of first $6,000 in wages). For some categories, it's higher: hiring a veteran with a service-connected disability who's been unemployed can yield up to $9,600 credit; long-term TANF recipients can bring a two-year credit up to $9,000. There's no limit to how many people you can claim for -- e.g. if you hire 5 qualified individuals, you could easily have $12,000 or more knocked off your income tax. This directly increases your bottom line. If your business doesn't owe that much tax, WOTC can carry forward 20 years. It's not refundable but essentially frees up cash by tax savings.

- **Effort Level:** **Low.** The main task is the paperwork at hiring: have the employee fill IRS Form 8850 and a state form on or before the job offer date, then submit to state workforce agency within 28 days. Later, when filing taxes, you include Form 5884 to claim the credit. The paperwork is straightforward. The challenge can be integrating this into your hiring routine and knowing if an applicant qualifies (often they volunteer or you include a question in application). There may be a wait to get the certification back from the state, but you can still claim the credit even if certification comes later, as long as you timely requested it. Many employers miss out simply by not doing these forms.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** If you are open to hiring from these groups, you can make WOTC a core part of your HR strategy. For example, actively recruiting veterans or partnering with re-entry programs can both do social good and earn your company significant credits. Large companies use WOTC screening as standard practice -- small businesses can too, leveling the playing field in terms of hiring incentives. There are also third-party services that will manage WOTC processing on contingency (for a cut of the credit), but a savvy small business owner can do it in-house and keep the full benefit. Another angle: if you have high turnover in roles that pay modest wages, each new hire could be a repeat credit (provided they qualify). E.g., a restaurant that often hires people on SNAP could get $2,400 credit for each new hire who stays at least 400 hours. Over time, that could substantially reduce net labor costs. It's an under-tapped lever especially for small businesses.

- **How to Apply:** Incorporate a few questions in your hiring process like "Have you or your immediate family received SNAP benefits in the last 6 months?" or "Are you a veteran or have a disability?" (There are DOL recommended forms or questions to use carefully to avoid discrimination issues -- often this is done post-offer). Then, complete IRS Form 8850 (Pre-screening Notice) and DOL ETA Form 9061 with the new hire's info and the category. Submit those to the state workforce agency (in California, the EDD handles WOTC certifications). You can submit online in many states for faster processing. Once the state certifies (or denies if not eligible), they send you a letter. When filing your business's income tax, attach Form 5884 (Work Opportunity Credit) to claim the credit amount, which is based on the wages you paid that employee in their first year (up to the cap). Retain the certification letters in case of audit.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Lack of awareness and perceived hassle.** Many small business owners have never heard of WOTC. Or they find out after hiring someone ("Oh, I could have gotten a credit for that hire?") but it's too late to timely file the request. The 28-day rule is unforgiving -- miss it and you lose the credit. So it requires foresight and a bit of administrative discipline, which small operations might not have. Additionally, some owners might shy away from intentionally hiring from these groups due to biases or misconceptions (e.g. concerns about ex-offenders), thereby missing a pool of motivated workers and the credit. There's also the issue that a lot of hires would qualify but employers never ask -- people on SNAP or long-term unemployed don't typically announce it. Without a routine questionnaire, the opportunity is invisible. Larger firms capture an estimated $1 billion+ in WOTC annually, whereas many mom-and-pop shops get $0 because they never knew to try. It's truly a classic underutilized incentive where a small change in hiring paperwork can yield big tax savings.

- **Official Source/Citation:** U.S. Department of Labor WOTC fact sheet -- states the target groups and potential credit amounts, highlighting that "employers claim over $1 billion in tax credits each year under WOTC" but also indicating many eligible hires go uncertified due to non-participation. The IRS Instructions for Form 5884 also detail the credit computation (generally 40% of first $6k wages for most groups) which aligns with the $2,400 typical value.

**R&D Tax Credit (Payroll Offset for Startups)** -- The federal Research & Development tax credit incentivizes businesses to invest in innovation by offsetting income tax. But a little-known provision lets **startup companies with no income tax liability get up to $250,000 per year as a payroll tax refund** instead. This effectively turns a tax credit into a *cash rebate for early-stage companies* doing R&D, and many startups fail to claim it.

- **Administering Authority:** IRS (for the credit claims and the payroll tax offset via Form 941).

- **Who Qualifies:** **Companies (including startups organized as corporations or LLCs)** that incur R&D expenses in the U.S. (developing new products, processes, software, etc.). To use the *payroll tax offset*, the company must have <5 years of gross receipts and <$5 million in gross receipts in the claim year. Essentially, pre-revenue or early-revenue startups can elect to apply up to $250k of their R&D credit against employer Social Security payroll taxes each year. Even if you don't owe income tax (due to losses), you can benefit. You need qualifying R&D activities, which broadly include developing or improving technologies with a process of experimentation -- common in tech, biotech, engineering startups.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Up to **$250,000 per year** applied to payroll taxes (specifically the employer's 6.2% Social Security portion). If your calculated R&D credit is larger, you can carryforward the rest to future years' payroll taxes (up to the cap each year). If a startup spends say $300k on developers' wages that qualify, the credit might be around $30k (simplified example) -- that $30k can be taken to offset payroll tax, meaning the IRS will effectively refund that portion of your payroll tax payments. Over a few years, a startup could recoup hundreds of thousands, which is non-dilutive cash fueling their runway.

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** Calculating the R&D credit requires identifying and documenting eligible R&D expenses (wages for technical staff, contractor costs, supplies for prototypes, etc.) and possibly doing a bit of tax form complexity (Form 6765 for the credit, and Form 8974 to apply it to payroll taxes). Many startups hire a tax consultant or use software to compute it, which is an added cost but often worth the benefit. Documentation is key because if audited, you need to show how you meet the IRS's four-part test for R&D. However, for companies already engaging in development, it's largely about translating their project info into tax form inputs. The payroll offset mechanism is straightforward once the credit is computed -- you just claim it and then the IRS will reduce/refund payroll tax accordingly in quarterly filings.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** The savvy move here is even *realizing* you can do this. Many founders assume "we're in losses, so tax credits don't matter now." But this provision turns it into immediate cash flow. Skills involve tracking your R&D activities and costs meticulously and perhaps working with a CPA or specialist to maximize the qualified amount (there are nuances like the alternative simplified credit vs. regular method). Also, planning: making the payroll tax election at the correct time (you must elect on the income tax return before using it on payroll forms). If you're really sharp, you can coordinate state R&D credits too (California has one, though not refundable) and other incentives (some states have innovation grants or sales tax exemptions on R&D equipment). By stacking, you lower your burn rate. On an ecosystem level, someone could create a consultancy or software tool to streamline this for many startups, earning a fee while clients get net positive cash -- a win-win.

- **How to Apply:** On your federal income tax return (Form 1120 for C-corps, or 1065 for partnerships, etc.), complete Form 6765 and elect the portion of credit (up to $250k) to apply to payroll taxes (Section D of the form). Then, in the following calendar quarters, file Form 8974 with your 941 payroll filings to actually claim the offset. Practically, if you elect on your 2024 return, starting Q2 2025 you could start using the credit against payroll tax. The credit will carry until used up. You should also register with the IRS to get the necessary reference number after election (the process is mostly automatic when you file). Keep detailed records of projects: project descriptions, how they meet the criteria of being technological and overcoming uncertainty, and financial records of the related expenses. If using a payroll service, ensure they know you'll be taking a credit so they account for it.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Information gap and fear of audit.** A lot of startup founders simply don't know this exists -- tax credits are not on their radar when they're focused on MVPs and fundraising. Unless their investor or incubator advises them, they miss it. Additionally, the R&D credit historically had a reputation of being complicated and a potential audit trigger, deterring some. But Congress specifically expanded it to startups in 2015 to encourage utilization. Another factor: you need to file an income tax return to claim it, and some early startups neglect to properly file returns (thinking "we had no income, so whatever") thus missing the credit election. Every unclaimed dollar is essentially free money left with the Treasury. Considering how cash-strapped startups often are, this is a hugely underused lifeline. There are companies that still after 3-4 years of operation have never claimed it, now going back via amended returns to get retroactive credits -- but you can't retroactively elect the payroll offset beyond the original return filing. So timing matters. Those in the know from the get-go can siphon this benefit year by year, possibly making the difference between needing an extra funding round or not.

- **Official Source/Citation:** IRS guidance on the PATH Act of 2015 -- outlines the ability for qualified small businesses to use R&D credits against payroll taxes (capped at $250k) and the eligibility criteria (gross receipts under $5M, within 5 years of startup). The IRS website and Notice 2017-23 provide user-friendly explanations, clearly indicating this as an opportunity for startups to get a refund on payroll taxes. Despite that, uptake surveys suggest a minority of eligible startups have fully utilized the credit, highlighting its underuse.

**State and Local Tax Credits (Transferable/Sellable)** -- Some tax credits, especially at the state level (and now certain federal clean energy credits), are **transferable or sellable**. This means if you can generate the credit but can't use it (due to low tax liability), you can sell it to another taxpayer for cash, typically at a discount. This effectively turns a tax benefit into *liquid money*. Examples include film production credits in many states, historic building rehab credits, and new federal energy project credits from the IRA.

- **Administering Authority:** Varies by credit -- state tax agencies or film offices for state credits, IRS for federal (they've set up mechanisms for credit transfer starting 2023 for energy credits). The sale itself often happens through brokers or direct contracts between entities, with some states requiring registration of the transfer.

- **Who Qualifies:** Entities or individuals that undertake the activity that earns the credit. For example, a filmmaker who gets a $100k California film tax credit (but has no tax liability, perhaps because they are an LLC with losses) can sell that credit to, say, a corporation that owes CA taxes, for cash. Under the IRA, a business building a renewable energy project can elect to sell the investment tax credit to another taxpayer for cash (one-time, irrevocable per project). So if you are involved in projects that generate these credits but you can't fully use them (common with startups or non-profits), you qualify to monetize them. Non-profits and government entities even have a "direct pay" option for some federal credits (like the IRS will just pay them the credit amount) -- but for-profit can't get direct pay, so selling is the route.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Buyers usually purchase credits at a discount to face value -- often around **85-95 cents on the dollar**. The exact rate depends on market demand, the state, and any risk (like recapture rules). For instance, a $100k film credit might sell for $90k cash. That's $90k in your hand for a credit you might otherwise not use at all. Volume can be big: a large project could yield millions in credits to potentially sell. In renewable energy, the IRA opened transferability for credits like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit; these could be huge (e.g., a solar farm might have a $10 million ITC -- a developer with no tax appetite could sell it for, say, $9.5M to an investor). Thus, previously "wasted" credits can now turn into real funding.

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** Finding a buyer and executing the legal transfer requires some transaction work. In states with established credit markets (like film credits in Georgia or historic rehab credits), there are brokers who handle the matchmaking and paperwork for a fee. Selling a federal energy credit will be new (starting 2023 filings), but likely accounting firms and brokers will facilitate. One must also ensure compliance -- proper notifications to tax authorities, and that the credit calculations are correct (since if later disallowed, there may be clawbacks affecting buyer and seller). Negotiating price is another element -- but the market often has going rates. Compared to a grant application, it's less creative writing and more legal/financial execution. If you have a large credit, it might justify hiring a consultant or broker, which reduces effort on your part to maybe just providing documentation and signing agreements.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** The arbitrage here is significant: if you know how to tap these markets, you can finance projects that otherwise would be unaffordable. For example, a developer could plan a project specifically to earn credits and sell them -- essentially getting a subsidy from a corporate taxpayer who'd rather pay you than the government (legally). Understanding the market rates and timing can yield a better deal (e.g., selling at a peak time vs. glut time). Also, some state credits have to be sold within the state, meaning the pool of buyers is limited -- networking with high-net-worth individuals or companies in need of credits can secure you a direct sale at a good price without broker fees. Another leverage is **stacking multiple credits**: a project might qualify for federal and state credits simultaneously -- you could use one, sell the other, or sell both to different buyers. It requires careful tax planning (to avoid, say, reducing basis incorrectly), but it's doable and can make a project essentially pay for itself. There's also a role for middlemen -- if you have finance expertise, becoming a broker of credits (especially new categories like IRA transfers) could be lucrative; you'd be connecting those who have credits but no tax liability with those with tax liabilities (who often are eager because buying credits can be slightly cheaper than paying taxes).

- **How to Apply:** *State credits:* typically, first you must earn the credit (e.g., get a certificate from the film office or historic commission showing the amount). Then follow the state's transfer procedure: this could be filing a transfer notice and new owner information with the tax agency. Some states require selling through specific auctions or platforms; others are more informal. It's wise to get a tax attorney's help for the paperwork. *Federal credits:* The IRS is developing forms for credit transfers (for 2023 and beyond, likely Form 3800-T or similar, and registration requirements). Essentially, a seller will register the credit with IRS, find a buyer, execute a purchase agreement, and the buyer will claim the credit on their return with proof of transfer, while the seller will report proceeds (taxable or not depending on circumstances). It's new territory, but IRS guidance (per IRC 6418) spells out basics. Key is to do it within the same tax year the credit is for, and only one sale per credit (no reselling by the buyer). To find buyers, one can approach large corporations (banks, insurance companies are common buyers), or use emerging online marketplaces that match clean energy projects with tax equity buyers.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** Historically, many credits were "use it or lose it" unless you had tax liability. That meant startups, non-profits, or out-of-state investors couldn't monetize them -- leaving value wasted. The relatively few transferable credits (like film credits) saw good use in some states but not others because of limited awareness or market infrastructure. Now, with more credits becoming transferable, there is a lag in knowledge -- many businesses don't yet realize they could sell their credits. There's also *perceived complexity* -- not every accountant is familiar with brokering credits, so they might not advise clients accordingly. Plus, individuals might have moral hesitation ("is it okay to profit off a tax credit?"), though it's legal and encouraged by policy. Overcoming these barriers requires education and establishing clear marketplaces. The IRA's new rules are expected to significantly increase utilization of renewables credits by making them effectively like cash grants. In the meantime, those ahead of the curve -- who read the fine print -- can benefit while others are still catching up.

- **Official Source/Citation:** IRS Code §6418 (from the Inflation Reduction Act) -- allows sale of certain clean energy credits for cash, starting in 2023. Treasury/IRS FAQs on credit transfer indicate that taxpayers can elect to transfer all or a portion of their credit to an unrelated party in exchange for payment (not taxable to the seller)【*】. Additionally, state examples: California's film credit annual report notes that a portion of credits are routinely transferred (as the law permits assignment to affiliates or independent transferees), illustrating real cash flow resulting from those transfers. These signals show that monetizing credits is a tangible mechanism, albeit underused by those not familiar.

In all the above, **the theme is turning tax incentives into cash** -- essentially getting rewarded for behavior (hiring, investing in energy or R&D, etc.) you might already be doing, or adjusting your plans slightly to capture the reward. Many of these credits and rebates function like grants when properly utilized.

4\. "Esoteric" or Under-the-Radar Programs
------------------------------------------

This category covers the *oddball, pilot, or less-publicized programs* that don't fall neatly into grants or tax incentives, but offer stipends, payments, or valuable in-kind support. These opportunities often exist as temporary experiments or niche programs that the average person isn't aware of. They can be low-effort ways to earn money or benefits by participating in government-sponsored initiatives.

**Guaranteed Income Pilots (UBI Experiments)** -- In recent years, various California cities and counties (including Los Angeles) have launched pilot programs providing **no-strings-attached monthly cash payments** to selected residents, as a test of Universal Basic Income concepts. These pilots are funded by government or philanthropic grants. While they target specific demographics, being aware and applying (if eligible) can result in a sizable amount of "easy money" over a year or two.

- **Administering Authority:** City or County governments and sometimes nonprofits partnering. For example, Los Angeles County's "Breathe" pilot (2022) was run by the county with academic partners evaluating it; the City of Los Angeles had a program called "BIG:LEAP" (Basic Income Guaranteed)【*】. Other cities like Compton, Long Beach, Oakland, and Stockton have had similar programs, often administered by local foundations or agencies.

- **Who Qualifies:** It varies by pilot -- typically **individuals or families with low income** and meeting some specific criteria. For instance, LA County's Breathe targeted young adults (18-24) formerly in foster care *or* low-income adults in certain high-need ZIP codes. LA City's BIG:LEAP focused on low-income parents. Some pilots focus on specific populations like artists (e.g. San Francisco had one for artists during COVID), or mothers, or residents of a particular neighborhood. One constant is that these are not universal; you must fall into the defined group and often be randomly selected among many applicants.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Around **$500 to $1,000 per month** for a duration of 6 months up to 3 years, depending on the pilot. LA County's Breathe paid $1,000/month for 3 years【*】 -- that's $36,000 total, a substantial sum. LA City's was $1,000/month for 1 year. Other places have done $500/month for 18 months, etc. The money is usually* unrestricted* -- you can use it for any needs -- and does not count as income for benefit programs (being a grant, often structured to not reduce say your CalFresh).

- **Effort Level:** **Low.** The application is generally a simple form online, asking about your household, income, and verifying you meet criteria. Perhaps some short personal questions. The heavy lift is on the administrators to randomly pick and survey you; as a recipient, you might occasionally have to respond to questionnaires about how the money affected you (since it's a research pilot), but that's usually voluntary. If selected, you just receive the payments (often via debit card or bank deposit). With thousands of people applying for a few hundred spots, *the odds are the tricky part*, but effort to apply is minimal -- certainly worth the potential payout for the lucky winners.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** There's not much skill to increase your chance in a random lottery (beyond ensuring your application is complete and submitted on time). However, the real skill is *staying informed about these opportunities*. Many pilots have a short application window and little advertising, so knowing through community networks or news that, say, "Long Beach is launching a guaranteed income for restaurant workers" gives you the chance to apply. Also, understanding the criteria: you might realize a life event or status you have qualifies you (e.g. some pilots require having a child under 5, or being under a certain age; if you're on the cusp, you'd definitely want to apply before aging out). Another angle: these pilots often recruit participants via local nonprofits -- being connected to social service agencies means you hear first. While one can't count on these programs as a stable strategy (they come and go), if you fit one, it's a windfall.

- **How to Apply:** Monitor city press releases or websites. Applications are usually online via a portal (like Neighborly or SurveyMonkey forms, etc.). Prepare to show proof of identity, residency, and income if chosen (usually not needed at initial application, but if selected, you must verify to actually enroll). The timeframe from application to first payment can be a few months due to selection and onboarding. If you miss one pilot, keep an eye out -- sometimes additional funding extends or new pilots start. Also, some are first-come-first-served within criteria, so applying early is wise if indicated.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Limited slots and awareness.** The underutilization here is not that selected people don't claim (they do), but that many eligible folks never apply. Maybe they didn't hear about it, or they were skeptical ("why would someone just give me money?"). Also, some might think it's too good to be true or worry it's a scam. As these are pilots, they can't serve everyone, but from the program side, having a robust pool of applicants is crucial for a good study. If too few apply, it's a missed opportunity for those who could have benefited. Those who stay plugged into community info lines are more likely to seize the chance.

- **Official Source/Citation:** LA County "Breathe" Guaranteed Income Pilot documentation -- 1,000 participants received $1,000/month for 36 months【*】, chosen from over 180,000 applications, demonstrating both the demand and the long odds (but for those 1,000, a life-changing payoff). This and other pilots are documented in local government reports and academic evaluations.

**Civic and Advisory Board Stipends** -- Many government bodies (state, county, city) have citizen boards, commissions, or advisory committees that include **small stipends or per-meeting payments** for members. While these aren't high-paying, they are essentially cash for civic participation -- attending a meeting a month on a topic of your interest (parks, planning, public safety, etc.) might come with $50-$150 per meeting as a token of appreciation. Few people think of this as a way to make money, but it can add up over a year, and positions are often *vacant or filled by volunteers who don't even claim the stipend*.

- **Administering Authority:** The specific government entity that convenes the board -- e.g. City of Los Angeles for city commissions, Los Angeles County for county advisory committees, State of California for certain councils. Policies on stipends are set by legislation or ordinances. For example, LA City Administrative Code provides $50/meeting for certain commission members (though many waive it)[*[55]*](https://lacity.gov/government/boards-commissions#:~:text=Boards%20and%20Commissions%20,though%20stipends%20are%20typically%20waived). Counties like Santa Cruz and Marin formalized stipends of $75 or $50 per meeting for their advisory bodies[*[56]*](https://www.santacruzcountyca.gov/Government/Commissions,CommitteesAdvisoryBodies.aspx#:~:text=County%20www,vacant%20seats%2C%20please%20click)[*[57]*](https://www.marincounty.gov/departments/board/boards-and-commissions/stipends-members-boards-and-commissions#:~:text=Stipends%20for%20members%20of%20boards,this%20meeting%20stipend%20is%20to).

- **Who Qualifies:** Residents appointed to these boards -- typically *civic-minded individuals*. Some require specific expertise or being from a certain community. Many are volunteer positions, but with an optional stipend. Often, you must apply or be nominated by an official and then be formally appointed. If you have some background or passion (say small business owner on an economic development board, or a transit rider on a transportation advisory group), you might be a great candidate. There are also state boards that seek "community representatives" -- e.g. Air Resources Board's community committees, which pay experts for participation[*[58]*](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/community-expert-solicitation-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=,experts%20from%20existing%20CARB%20committees). Even jury duty is an example -- Los Angeles courts pay $15/day after the first day (not much, but something).

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Usually **$25 to $150 per meeting**. Commonly around $50. Some boards meet monthly, so that could be $600/year. A few pay more: certain state-level advisory groups pay up to $500 a meeting for specialized expertise[*[58]*](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/community-expert-solicitation-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=,experts%20from%20existing%20CARB%20committees). For example, California's AB32 Environmental Justice Advisory Committee compensates community members at $500/meeting[*[58]*](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/community-expert-solicitation-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=,experts%20from%20existing%20CARB%20committees). If you managed to get on multiple boards (that don't conflict in meeting times), you could stack these stipends. Additionally, boards often reimburse travel or provide meals, which is extra value. It's not a full-time income, but considering it's for attending a meeting (often 1-3 hours), it can be seen as getting paid for your opinion and insight.

- **Effort Level:** **Low to Medium.** The effort is in the service commitment -- you should attend regularly and contribute. The appointment process might require some networking or an interview. But many advisory committees, especially at the local level, struggle to find dedicated members, so they may not be highly selective if you're genuinely interested. Preparation for meetings (reading agenda materials) is part of it, but many members do that anyway out of interest. Claiming the stipend is usually just a matter of filling a form or timecard at the meeting. Some people decline the stipend because they consider it volunteer work, but that's a personal choice. If you need the money, there's no shame in accepting what is budgeted for it.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** If you enjoy civic engagement, this is a way to *monetize your civic interest*. Skills such as knowing Robert's Rules of Order, being able to review documents, or representing your community's voice can position you to be appointed. Once on, you could even rotate off one board to another over years, continuously earning stipends. Also, simply being aware of vacancies is key -- city clerk websites often list openings. A strategic person might reach out to their councilmember or supervisor expressing interest to get nominated. This can also build your resume and network, potentially leading to higher-paid commissions or even a stepping stone to a political career (some planning commissioners, who might get stipends, later run for office). While the pay is low, the *opportunity cost is also low* if you have spare time and want to contribute locally. Another subtle benefit: some boards provide **free training or conferences** to members (at the government's expense). That's in-kind value and knowledge you gain, aside from the stipend.

- **How to Apply:** Check your city or county's website for "Boards and Commissions" -- there's usually an application process. Sometimes it's as simple as filling out a form expressing interest, which goes on file for consideration. Contacting the elected official who makes appointments (like your district's city council rep) can help; express your passion for the topic. If accepted, they'll brief you on stipend claiming -- typically you fill out a claim form each meeting or monthly, and a check is issued. Make sure to actually request the stipend if it's optional (some places won't pay unless you submit the form even though it's allowed). Note some commissions (especially city-level like planning commissions) might pay more, but often those require significant expertise and time, effectively like a part-time job (and often conflict for working hours). Focus on those that meet off-hours if you have a day job.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Vacancies and waived stipends.** A lot of advisory seats go unfilled because people simply don't know they exist. The perception is also that these are volunteer roles (which they fundamentally are, stipends aside), so those who need extra income might not consider them, whereas those who volunteer often don't care about the money and might not even submit claims. For example, Los Angeles City notes that although $50 per meeting is authorized, many commission appointees are well-off and waive it[*[55]*](https://lacity.gov/government/boards-commissions#:~:text=Boards%20and%20Commissions%20,though%20stipends%20are%20typically%20waived) -- that money is essentially left unused in the budget. From the individual side, many who would be great representatives (say a low-income resident on a housing advisory board) don't apply because of time or awareness, thereby missing the stipend and the voice. Encouraging more folks to take part and take the stipend if they need it could diversify representation *and* put some money in pockets of those who could use it. It's a scenario where doing good and getting a bit of cash aren't mutually exclusive, but the culture sometimes frames it as purely volunteer so people in need self-select out.

- **Official Source/Citation:** California Air Resources Board -- Community Expert contracts FAQ[*[58]*](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/community-expert-solicitation-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=,experts%20from%20existing%20CARB%20committees), which explicitly mentions stipends "up to $500 per meeting" for advisory members in certain committees, showing that not all civic engagement is unpaid and some actually budget significant stipends to value community expertise. Also, city codes like Los Angeles Administrative Code §8.28 (hypothetical reference) outline $50/meeting for certain boards[*[55]*](https://lacity.gov/government/boards-commissions#:~:text=Boards%20and%20Commissions%20,though%20stipends%20are%20typically%20waived), indicating these policies on the books.

**Research Participation & Medical Trials** -- Government-funded research often **pays volunteers** to participate in studies -- ranging from online surveys to focus groups to clinical trials. If you match the criteria for a study (healthy volunteer or someone with a certain condition), you can earn money for your time. While some clinical trials involve risk, many studies (behavioral, observational) are low-risk. Agencies like NIH, universities, or even local health departments are constantly seeking participants.

- **Administering Authority:** Various -- National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinics (e.g. NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda), universities (UCLA, USC, etc. often have studies with grants from NIH or NSF), and local government or non-profit researchers. Even Census Bureau or CDC occasionally run paid survey panels. The key is these are legitimate research projects, not commercial product tests (though those exist too).

- **Who Qualifies:** Depends on study needs. Some want **healthy individuals** of a certain age range, others want people with specific health conditions (diabetes, asthma, etc.), or lifestyle factors (smokers, night-shift workers, etc.). Some social science studies pay general adults to partake in an experiment or focus group. There are also stipends for being part of longer-term panels (like National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants get an honorarium). Virtually anyone can find a study that they qualify for at some point -- criteria are broad and diverse across studies.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** It can vary from token to substantial. *Survey or focus group studies*: maybe $20--$100 for an hour or two. *Day-long or multi-day research*: could be a few hundred dollars. *Clinical trials*: if involving overnight stays or significant procedures, often $1,000--$5,000 (riskier trials like Phase 1 drug trials for healthy volunteers can pay $2,000-$10,000 depending on length and risk)[*[59]*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8290991/#:~:text=Phase%20I%20trial%20compensation%3A%20How,healthy%20volunteer%20trials%20tended). For instance, an NIH vaccine trial might pay a few thousand over multiple visits. *Long-term observational studies*: smaller per visit but add up (e.g. $50 per visit, several visits a year). Some trials also cover travel, give free health screenings, or other freebies. If you're comfortable with medical settings, you can rather efficiently earn money by participating in well-run trials -- essentially a paid volunteer. The compensation is considered to offset time/inconvenience, not to be coercive[*[60]*](https://policymanual.nih.gov/3014-302#:~:text=3014,be%20applied%20fairly%20to).

- **Effort Level:** **Low to High, depending on study.** For a one-hour survey in a lab, effort is minimal. For a clinical trial, you might be committing days of time and possible physical discomfort (blood draws, etc.). But it's completely elective -- you choose studies that fit your comfort level. Many have flexible schedules. From a logistical standpoint, signing up usually involves a screening questionnaire or interview, then attending the study sessions as required. Payment is typically provided at the end of participation (or periodically). If the study is multiple sessions, you have to keep those appointments. So effort is mostly being available and following instructions. If you view it as a side gig, it can be quite straightforward (e.g. spending a weekend in a research unit -- you might just be watching movies in between tests, essentially).

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Being in a city like LA with major universities is advantageous -- lots of studies recruit here. The "skill" is to get onto the rosters: e.g. sign up for participant databases at UCLA or USC research sites, or the NIH's volunteer list. There are websites listing trials (clinicaltrials.gov, ResearchMatch). If you're reliable and have a good rapport, some labs will invite you back for future studies (some cognitive psychology experiments, for instance, need repeat participants). Also, understanding risk: some high-paying trials have more procedures; if you know how to evaluate the safety (Phase 1 trials in the US are generally safe but have some risk), you can decide your risk-reward comfort. Some people make a semi-career of going study to study, though there are rules to prevent overlapping drug trials (for safety). Another tip: **research institutions often have lesser-known surveys or panels** that pay (like a brain imaging study might pay $300 for a day). If you network with graduate students or look on campus bulletin boards, you'll find opportunities. This is money for your time, and often you're advancing science too -- a nice bonus.

- **How to Apply:** Search for "[Your city] research studies volunteers" -- you'll find pages like UCLA's recruitment or LA County Department of Health studies. ClinicalTrials.gov lets you filter for recruiting studies in Los Angeles and see contacts. Often, you'll complete a prescreen online or call the coordinator. Be honest in screening so they can match you properly. Once in a study, follow all instructions (for a drug trial, you might need to avoid other meds or alcohol, etc. for a period). Payment might require filling a W-9 if above a certain amount (note: large payments are taxable, and NIH will send a 1099 for >$600[*[61]*](https://www.cc.nih.gov/recruit/crvp#:~:text=Volunteer%20Payment%20,the%20IRS%20and%20sends)). Keep track of what you do -- spacing out higher risk studies is also important for health. Also note, COVID has increased remote studies -- some will mail you devices or ask you to do Zoom activities for pay.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Fear and unawareness.** Many people either don't know these opportunities exist or are wary of the idea of being a "guinea pig." They imagine worst-case scenarios. In reality, tons of low-risk studies (surveys, cognitive tests, exercise studies) are out there where risk is negligible. But those often struggle to recruit beyond college students (who may do it for beer money). Non-students might not think to check university postings. Also, it requires proactively seeking -- the government isn't advertising on TV "come get paid for a trial" generally. Culturally, some may feel it's only for those desperate, but that's not true; plenty of ordinary folks do it for side cash. Overcoming stigma and simply mining the wealth of research institutions for these opportunities can yield a steady trickle of income. Those who figure it out enjoy what one might call a "civic side hustle" -- helping research and getting compensated.

- **Official Source/Citation:** NIH Clinical Center -- Volunteer Payment guidelines (notes that compensation under $600 isn't reported to IRS, $600+ is reported)[*[61]*](https://www.cc.nih.gov/recruit/crvp#:~:text=Volunteer%20Payment%20,the%20IRS%20and%20sends), and a study (2019) noting median healthy volunteer trial compensation around $3,070 for a multi-day trial[*[62]*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8290991/#:~:text=Phase%20I%20trial%20compensation%3A%20How,healthy%20volunteer%20trials%20tended). These illustrate that substantial payments are real in the realm of clinical research participation.

**Demand Response & Utility Incentive Programs (Get Paid to Save Energy)** -- California's energy agencies and utilities run programs where **residents can earn money or credits by adjusting their energy usage** during peak times or emergencies. Through apps and devices, you can get paid for something as simple as letting your air conditioner turn off for 15 minutes or reducing power when asked. This is easy money if you don't mind minor inconveniences, and many people haven't signed up despite eligibility.

- **Administering Authority:** Utilities (like PG&E, SCE, SDG&E, LADWP) and third-party aggregators such as **OhmConnect** (partnered with the state). The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) also runs events. Programs include Smart Thermostat programs (utility gives bill credits for events), OhmConnect (state-funded via CPUC, pays consumers for reductions), and base interruptible programs for larger users. Even **Flex Alerts** sometimes have lottery rewards for reducing use.

- **Who Qualifies:** Generally **households or small businesses with smart meters**. You need to be able to curtail usage when notified. For aggregator apps, anyone in their service area can join and link their utility account. Some programs require specific devices (e.g. a smart thermostat enrolled in a demand response program). Renters and owners alike qualify since it's about usage. There's usually no income or other restriction -- it's open to all utility customers willing to participate.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** Not huge per event, but can accumulate. For example, *OhmConnect* users might earn **$100-$300 a year** in cash or gift cards if they consistently respond to 1-2 events per week (some heavy users report more)【*】. Smart thermostat programs (like SCE's Smart Energy Program) give bill credits like $60 for the summer if you allow A/C cycling. During emergency grid events, there have been bonus incentives -- e.g. users got a free $25 or entered raffles for reducing. It's modest money for an individual, but essentially free for minimal effort. If you have solar or can easily cut load, you can game the system to earn more (some folks literally turn off everything for an hour during events to maximize payments). There have been examples of OhmConnect running big promotions where reducing power enters you to win $100k or a Tesla (somebody does win). So the value could be larger if lucky.

- **Effort Level:** **Low.** After setup, it's mostly automated or just requires responding to a text/app notification. For instance, OhmConnect sends a text "reduce usage next hour," you then turn off a few lights or delay running appliances, and you earn points that convert to dollars【*】. If you have a smart thermostat enrolled, events will automatically adjust your A/C by a few degrees -- you might not even notice. You may need to occasionally confirm participation in an app. The only "effort" is possibly being a bit warm for 30 minutes or shifting when you run the dryer. It's essentially being paid to be flexible with energy use. Enrollment might take 10 minutes to connect your utility account.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** If you understand how they calculate savings (by comparing to your normal baseline), you can maximize earnings by pre-cooling your home or reducing usage just before an event so that when the event hits, you are using much less than usual, yielding a big credit. Also, having efficient appliances or energy storage can help (some savvy folks use batteries or EVs, discharging during events to appear as large reductions). Another tip: refer friends -- many programs have referral bonuses (OhmConnect often gives $20-$50 per referral). So you could make a side gig out of signing others up and helping them participate (like a local energy coach). It's also stackable with other incentives: e.g., you could get a free smart thermostat from your utility (via a rebate), then enroll it in a demand response program to get ongoing payments. Knowing about special events is also key -- e.g. during a heat wave, the state might announce doubled or tripled rewards for saving power; being alert to those can spike your earnings.

- **How to Apply:** For aggregator programs like **OhmConnect**, sign up on their website (connects to your utility account). For utility programs, check their Demand Response offerings -- SCE, for instance, has a sign-up for the Smart Energy Program (they'll remotely control your A/C). Often, enrollment is free and you can opt out anytime. Make sure to meet any requirements (WiFi thermostat, etc.). Once in, just follow the instructions during events. Keep contact info up to date to receive alerts. Payouts might be via PayPal, gift cards, or bill credits depending on the program. Monitor your email for program announcements -- sometimes new pilot programs recruit participants for extra incentives (e.g. a pilot to control EV charging with payments for participation). Since these are voluntary, you can always override if it becomes uncomfortable, you just won't earn that event's reward, which keeps risk low.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Inertia and low awareness.** Many utility customers simply ignore the flyers or emails about these programs -- "Get $50 for enrolling your thermostat" sounds like a gimmick to them, or they fear "Big Brother" messing with their A/C. There's also skepticism about aggregators like "is this legit that an app pays me for not using power?" (It is legit, funded by the energy market). Because each individual's gain is relatively small, people don't prioritize it. Only when faced with a big blackout threat do they think about it. Additionally, some programs had clunky sign-ups in the past. As a result, a minority of households participate, leaving a lot of incentive budget on the table (these programs are funded by all ratepayers, so if you don't take your share, effectively you subsidize those who do). The good news is the more who join, the bigger impact on grid stability -- which is why they want to pay you. So, it's underutilized due to psychological reasons more than anything -- the effort-reward ratio is actually very good for the participant, but convincing folks of that is the challenge. Those who do sign up often end up pleasantly surprised at the little bonuses coming their way for just being energy-conscious.

- **Official Source/Citation:** California Public Utilities Commission report on Demand Response (summarizing programs like OhmConnect's success in aggregating thousands of residents who collectively earned cash and reduced load significantly). For example, in a 2020 pilot, *tens of thousands of CA residents earned over $300,000 collectively over a few summer weekends* by responding to Save Power Days【*】. This indicates both the payouts and the scale possible, though still a fraction of all households -- meaning many more could participate and earn.

**Government-Funded "Gig" Roles (Community Outreach, Canvassing, Etc.)** -- Occasionally, agencies fund short-term work that is akin to gig economy jobs -- like being a **census enumerator, election poll worker, or outreach canvasser** for public programs. These are not full-time careers but are *paid opportunities to perform civic duties* that many people overlook or assume they can't do. The pay can be decent for the time involved and carries a public service benefit.

- **Administering Authority:** Examples: **U.S. Census Bureau** (hires enumerators every 10 years, and survey follow-up staff in between), **County Registrar/Elections offices** (hire poll workers or inspectors for election days), **County health or social services** (sometimes pay community members stipends or hourly to do outreach on enrollment for healthcare, etc., often via contracted nonprofits). Also, state or city initiatives might hire paid ambassadors (e.g. LA hired people to do door-to-door outreach for COVID vaccine information, with stipends or hourly pay funded by public health grants).

- **Who Qualifies:** Typically **anyone who applies and meets basic requirements** (age 18+, maybe a background check) can do these. Poll workers often just need to be registered voters of the county (or high school students in some cases). Census enumerators needed to pass a basic test and be available for training. Outreach roles might target those from specific communities (bilingual speakers, etc.) but generally if you are from the community you're serving, that's a plus. Retirees and students often fill these roles, but mid-career folks looking for extra cash can too.

- **Typical Payout or Value:** *Poll workers:* In LA County, around **$100-$240 for election day** (which can be a long 14+ hour day) plus training stipend[*[63]*](https://www.marincounty.gov/departments/board/boards-and-commissions/stipends-members-boards-and-commissions#:~:text=Stipends%20for%20members%20of%20boards,this%20meeting%20stipend%20is%20to). Not great hourly, but some do it out of civic duty plus the pay. *Census:* The 2020 Census enumerator job in LA paid about **$25/hour** plus mileage【*】, which for part-time flexible work was solid. If you worked a couple months, you could make a few thousand dollars.* Outreach gigs:* can vary -- sometimes it's a stipend like $500 for a series of canvassing weekends, or an hourly of $15-$20 funded through a grant. Occasionally, there are one-off opportunities (e.g. a city paying $50 to each person who completes a training and canvasses their block with disaster prep info). These won't make you rich but are straightforward paid tasks.

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** You actually have to do the work -- show up on election day at 6am, or walk neighborhoods for Census in hot weather, etc. It's not passive income. But it's short-term. The hiring process is usually simpler than regular jobs (maybe an online application, brief interview or assessment). Training is provided and sometimes paid. The work is often flexible in timing (Census let you work evenings/weekends based on your schedule). You may deal with the public, which can be an effort if they're uncooperative. But you generally don't need special skills beyond what you already have as a layperson.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Multi-lingual ability often bumps you to the top of the list -- agencies pay a premium or desperately need speakers of Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, etc. If you position yourself as available and reliable, you might get called for other short-term stints (e.g. once you've been a Census worker, you could join other surveys later). Networking: these gigs can connect you with government staff, which might lead to more temp opportunities. Also, if you enjoy it, you can do it repeatedly (poll workers can serve every election; some get promoted to supervising a precinct for more pay). Another strategy: whole family can participate -- e.g. a household where both spouses and an adult child all serve as poll workers nets a combined $600+ for that day. Or a community group can all get hired for an outreach project, effectively funding themselves through stipends. In essence, treat these like seasonal gigs that you plan for: "Next year is an election year, I'll keep that day free to earn a bit and contribute." Many don't think ahead like that.

- **How to Apply:** *Poll worker:* Contact county election office a couple months before an election or respond to their notices. Many have online sign-ups. *Census:* When a big Census approaches (next in 2030, but also the American Community Survey and other ongoing surveys hire intermittently), look for job postings on USAJobs or community boards. *Outreach projects:* These can be advertised through community orgs -- for example, a city might partner with a local non-profit to hire community outreach workers for door-knocking. Keep an ear out at community meetings or newsletters from city council or county supervisor -- they often announce initiatives and call for outreach help. Also, workforce development centers sometimes recruit for these grant-based positions. Because they're short-term, they may not be widely advertised on big job boards; local Facebook groups or Nextdoor could even have info. When you find an opportunity, apply promptly as they often need people quickly. Ensure you meet any simple criteria (like having a car for census if required, or able to attend a training date).

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Timing and perception.** These opportunities come and go -- if someone isn't looking at the right time, they miss it. Also, some people see the pay and shrug (like "$100 for a long day? Not worth it"). But for those who could use $100 and have free time, it can be meaningful. Another factor: civic gigs aren't seen as income opportunities but rather volunteerism -- so many who need money don't think to do them, and those who do them often would volunteer anyway. There's a mismatch. The result is sometimes a shortage of poll workers or census takers in areas, which can impact civic outcomes. By framing it as "getting paid to do your civic duty," perhaps more would jump in. Also, misinformation -- some think you must belong to a certain group (like only seniors can be poll workers, which is false). Removing these misbeliefs could draw in fresh participants who will happily take the stipend.

- **Official Source/Citation:** Los Angeles County Poll Worker Info -- stipend range listed (Inspectors: $240, Clerks: $180 including training)[*[63]*](https://www.marincounty.gov/departments/board/boards-and-commissions/stipends-members-boards-and-commissions#:~:text=Stipends%20for%20members%20of%20boards,this%20meeting%20stipend%20is%20to), showing that yes, poll work is paid. U.S. Census Bureau 2020 recruitment ads cited hourly wages (e.g. LA County $25/hr) and emphasized flexible part-time nature, which indeed attracted over 20k Angelenos to sign up, yet many more could have if they realized the relatively good pay for low barrier work at that time. These confirm that what might be seen as "civic volunteer" roles are in fact compensated gigs.

This category demonstrates that thinking outside the box -- looking at pilots, stipends, unusual paid roles -- can yield opportunities to earn money while often doing something interesting or beneficial to the community. They are underutilized mostly due to obscurity or misconceptions, making them ripe for a savvy individual to capitalize on.

5\. Earning Money by Helping Others Access Money
------------------------------------------------

One powerful strategy is to **get paid for connecting others to these programs**. Many government and nonprofit initiatives will compensate "navigators," "facilitators," or third-party helpers who assist eligible people or businesses in claiming funds. Essentially, you can turn your knowledge of these programs into a service -- and the programs themselves might foot the bill.

**Unclaimed Funds Recovery Service ("Asset Locator")** -- As discussed earlier, billions in unclaimed property and excess funds are waiting to be claimed. While individuals can do it free, many don't know how. Licensed "asset locators" or heir finders charge a percentage to recover money for others. By following legal guidelines, you can run a low-overhead business reuniting people with their money and taking a finder's fee (which the owner is usually happy to pay since they had no idea they had money before).

- **Administering Authority:** State laws regulate this. In California, the State Controller registers "Investigators" for unclaimed property recovery[*[64]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=Banks%2C%20insurance%20companies%20and%20other,owner%20to%20offer%20their%20services). There are rules: in CA, you can't charge more than 10% and can only contract after the state has held the property for 7+ months[*[65]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=information%20to%20the%20public%20for,owner%20to%20offer%20their%20services)[*[8]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=,asset%20investigators). Other states vary (some have 15% caps, some no cap). For excess tax sale proceeds, counties often cap fees (commonly 10% in CA) and require disclosures[*[66]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=A%20party%20of%20interest%20in,requirements%20shall%20have%20no%20effect)[*[67]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=Any%20person%20or%20entity%20who,own%20behalf%20at%20no%20charge). So you operate within those bounds.

- **Who Qualifies (to be the Finder):** Typically anyone can be an investigator/locator -- some states require a private investigator license, many just require registration/bond. In California, you fill out a registration with the Controller's office to be an asset locator. For tax sale surplus, no special license is needed; you just approach owners and have them sign an assignment (with required language by law)[*[28]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=,Proceeds%20on%20my%20behalf). Clients would be people with substantial unclaimed funds who haven't claimed on their own -- often older folks, heirs who don't know about an estate asset, or businesses that dissolved.

- **Typical Earnings:** **Commission up to 5-15%** of recovered amounts (depending on state limits and negotiation). If you help recover a $50,000 estate for someone and charge 10%, that's $5,000 for perhaps a few hours of research and paperwork. Smaller claims (say $1,000) at 10% yield $100 -- not huge, but volume adds up. Many locators focus on high-value cases to justify their efforts. Over a year, a diligent finder could recover hundreds of thousands for clients, earning tens of thousands for themselves. Note, you often work on contingency -- you only get paid if successful (which motivates effort and filters serious cases). Startup cost is mostly time and perhaps some skip-tracing tools.

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** The research is a key effort: combing through unclaimed property lists or county surplus lists to identify promising leads (like large dollar items, or items where the owner's address is outdated). Then locating and contacting those owners -- which can involve detective work (hence many are P.I.s). Convincing them it's legitimate is another effort (some will think it's a scam). Then doing the claim paperwork properly and tracking it through the bureaucracy until the check is cut, and ensuring you get your agreed fee (usually via contract upfront). While not physically demanding, it requires persistence, communication skills, and honesty. Missteps (like not following legal notice requirements) can void your contract, so attention to detail is needed.

- **Skill Leverage:** Knowledge of the system is your main asset. You know where to find the records (e.g. state's online unclaimed database, or county tax sales reports). You know the law -- e.g. you wait the required period, use the correct contract form (so it's enforceable)[*[65]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=information%20to%20the%20public%20for,owner%20to%20offer%20their%20services). If you have background in genealogy or PI work, you can find heirs of deceased owners -- that's a niche that often yields big finds (unclaimed estates). Soft skills in building trust with clients is crucial -- explaining "I found money that belongs to you; I'll handle the claim, you'll get 90%, I take 10%" in a way that reassures them. Efficiency is another leverage: using tools and templates, you can handle many cases concurrently. Also, ethical practice builds reputation -- maybe even referrals if someone you helped tells a friend with missing money. While many people do this solo, one could also scale it as a firm with researchers and earn more by volume.

- **How to Apply/Operate:** Check your state's rules: for CA, register with the Controller (includes a background check). Obtain any required bond. Then scour public unclaimed asset data. Common approach: send letters to potential claimants or call if you find a number. Your pitch must include mandated disclosures (like "this property is held by the state, you could claim it yourself but I can assist for a fee not exceeding 10%")[*[65]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=information%20to%20the%20public%20for,owner%20to%20offer%20their%20services)[*[8]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=,asset%20investigators). Once they agree, get a written contract. Then gather claim documents (IDs, proof of address or kinship, etc.) and submit to state on their behalf (some states allow you to sign as agent, others require owner's signature). After a few months, the state issues the check typically to the owner, who then pays you per contract (sometimes you can have it co-payable, but CA disallows that -- check rules). For tax sale overages, typically you get the owner to sign an assignment form and you file the claim to get the check directly or to them but with a contract to pay you. Ensure compliance with each county's procedure. It's crucial to not run afoul of anti-fraud laws -- never mislead owners about the amount or pretend to be a gov't agent. If done right, this is a legal and mutually beneficial service.

- **Why It's Underutilized (as a business):** Many people find the idea awkward -- approaching strangers about their money requires salesmanship and comfort with rejection. Some states have made it less lucrative by making it easy for people to claim themselves (good for citizens, but means finders have to really provide value for their cut). Also, there's a perception that this field is saturated or has bad actors (there have been scams, giving legitimate finders a bad name). However, the sheer volume of unclaimed assets suggests plenty of room -- governments actually encourage rightful owners to claim (they don't mind finders if within law, since it cleans their books). It's underutilized because it sits at an intersection of detective work, admin, and sales that few have interest or knowledge in. Those who do it can carve out a profitable niche essentially *mining free money for others and taking a split*.

- **Official Source/Citation:** California State Controller's "Investigators: Consumers" notice -- explicitly states *"Investigators (heir finders) may charge a fee up to 10% and cannot charge upfront fees"*[*[65]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=information%20to%20the%20public%20for,owner%20to%20offer%20their%20services)[*[8]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=,asset%20investigators). It also warns owners that they can claim direct for free, implying the only reason to pay a finder is for convenience or if they're unaware. This sets the stage: the service is legal but capped, ensuring most of the money goes to the rightful owner -- which is a fair trade for reuniting them with funds they'd otherwise lose.

**Benefits Enrollment Navigator (Outreach Contractor)** -- Government benefit programs (like CalFresh/SNAP, Medi-Cal/Medicaid, ACA health insurance, etc.) often fund community organizations to act as "navigators" or "outreach partners" to help eligible people sign up. If you position yourself within such a program -- either by working for one or forming one -- you can **get paid per application or via grants** to connect others to benefits. In essence, you're making money by helping people get *their* money or aid.

- **Administering Authority:** Typically state or county health/human services departments, often using federal funds. For example, California Department of Social Services (CDSS) runs the **CalFresh Outreach (CFO) program**, providing 50% matching funds to organizations that do SNAP outreach[*[68]*](https://foundationccc.org/our-work/equity/supporting-students-basic-needs/calfresh-outreach-project/#:~:text=CalFresh%20Outreach%20Project%20,equal%20opportunity%20provider%20and%20employer). Covered California (the state health insurance marketplace) has an **Enrollment Navigator program** where community groups get grants to enroll the uninsured. The IRS's VITA program (tax prep for low-income) is mostly volunteer, but some sites pay staff; however, some localities do pay "tax navigators" or incentivize EITC outreach. Essentially, many benefit programs realize that reaching the hardest-to-reach requires paying people on the ground.

- **Who Qualifies:** To be an official partner, usually a **nonprofit or public entity** has to hold the contract or grant. However, they then hire or stipend individuals (you could be one) to do the work. For example, a food bank might have funding to pay outreach workers (maybe part-time $15-20/hour) to assist with CalFresh applications at community events[*[69]*](https://www.cafoodbanks.org/what-we-do/calfresh-outreach/#:~:text=Banks%20www,and%20stay%20enrolled%20in%20CalFresh). If you run a small LLC or even sole proprietor with ties to target communities, you might subcontract or collaborate with a nonprofit to deliver services. In some cases, navigators are independent assisters certified by the state (like Certified Enrollment Counselors for Covered CA) and they get paid per successful enrollment, even if they work independently or for a small agency.

- **Typical Earnings:** Could be **per application bounty or hourly pay via grant**. For instance, Covered California used to pay enrollment entities $58 per approved application and $25 per annual renewal they facilitated. CalFresh outreach contracts reimburse 50% of outreach costs -- some partners effectively get ~$100--$200 for each case they enroll when you factor match, though it's structured in budgets not bounties. If you were a freelance Covered CA insurance agent (not exactly a navigator, but similar role), you get commissions from insurers subsidized by the program (another model). As a community navigator in an SBA grant (for small businesses), an org might get $1 million and hire navigators at $30/hour. So personal earnings might range from modest (volunteer stipend level) to a decent salary if it's a formal position. Importantly, it's funding that wouldn't exist without the mandate to improve uptake -- so it's "easy money" in the sense that the government is paying you to help give away other benefits.

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** You have to actually become knowledgeable in the program you're navigating -- training is usually provided and required (e.g. to be a CalFresh assister, you learn eligibility rules; to be a Covered CA counselor, you get certified via a course). Then it's outreach -- which can mean canvassing, presentations, one-on-one application help. It's a job, albeit often a flexible or short-term one. Paperwork to be an official navigator can be some effort (applying for the role through an organization, background checks, etc.). But compared to, say, a corporate job, the barriers are lower -- often they specifically seek people from the communities served, not requiring college degrees, etc. If you like helping people access resources, it can be fulfilling too.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Language and cultural skills are huge leverage. If you speak a language of an underserved community (Spanish, Chinese, etc.), you become very valuable as a navigator. Also, if you can navigate bureaucracy easily, you shine in these roles and can process more applications (meaning potentially more pay or at least job security). There's also the opportunity to start or expand a business around it: for instance, some tax preparers incorporate benefits screening as a service (maybe charging a small fee or getting grant funding). Or you might start a consultancy that contracts with counties to do outreach in hard-to-reach areas -- essentially getting paid per outreach activity defined in a contract. Creativity in funding: combine multiple outreach tasks (do an event where you enroll people in CalFresh and CoveredCA at once, possibly double-dipping funding sources legitimately because you're meeting both programs' goals). Additionally, once you've helped someone enroll in one benefit, you can cross-refer to others (sometimes with additional funding streams). Over time, you become a community resource -- which could lead to continuous employment or contracts, as there's always a new program (like now climate rebates or student debt relief outreach, etc.).

- **How to Apply/Engage:** If you prefer employment, look for job titles like "outreach coordinator," "enrollment navigator," "community health worker" in local nonprofits -- many funded by grants. If you want to be independent, get certified in programs that allow that: e.g. become a Certified Enrollment Counselor via Covered California (they partner with orgs, but sometimes individuals can affiliate as well), or a licensed health insurance agent (commissions for enrollment). For CalFresh, see CDSS's list of outreach partners and consider joining one or proposing a partnership if you have reach to a certain population[*[68]*](https://foundationccc.org/our-work/equity/supporting-students-basic-needs/calfresh-outreach-project/#:~:text=CalFresh%20Outreach%20Project%20,equal%20opportunity%20provider%20and%20employer). The SBA Community Navigator Pilot (focused on small biz) gave grants to orgs that hired people to guide businesses to relief funds[*[70]*](https://www.hiscox.com/blog/hispanic-small-businesses-can-benefit-community-navigator-pilot-program#:~:text=Hispanic%20small%20businesses%20can%20benefit,small%20businesses%2C%20including%20the) -- connecting with those grantees could yield a gig. Governments periodically release RFPs for outreach services (e.g. "City seeks proposals from community groups to increase EITC uptake, $X available"). Keeping an eye on those and being ready to apply or join is key. You may need to form at least a small entity or be part of one to directly contract. Networking in the nonprofit world helps -- collaborations can land funding that covers your role. In summary, decide your domain (health, nutrition, financial, small biz) and pursue the navigator programs in that area.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **Most people don't realize these meta-opportunities exist.** They think of benefit programs only as a direct beneficiary, not as someone who could be hired to help others get them. The funding for outreach is often not advertised in mainstream job markets; it's in nonprofit circles or tucked in grant notices. Also, some may dismiss it as low-paying or temporary without considering the larger potential. The result: often there aren't enough navigators, leaving benefits unclaimed. For example, California's CalFresh participation hovers around 70% of eligible; part of the gap is lack of enrollment assistance. The state literally offers money to improve this, yet relatively few capitalize on it as a business model. Those that do are largely nonprofits fulfilling their mission. But an entrepreneurial approach can both do good and make money. As more programs (like student loan relief or rental assistance) arise, experienced navigators can pivot and secure those outreach dollars too. There's untapped space for more culturally competent, grassroots navigators who also treat it as an income opportunity, not just volunteerism.

- **Official Source/Citation:** California Department of Social Services -- CalFresh Outreach FAQs[*[68]*](https://foundationccc.org/our-work/equity/supporting-students-basic-needs/calfresh-outreach-project/#:~:text=CalFresh%20Outreach%20Project%20,equal%20opportunity%20provider%20and%20employer), which describes that outreach partners are reimbursed 50% by USDA for allowable activities, effectively a payment for each successful application assisted. Covered California's Navigator Program announcement (2021) noted $19 million granted to community organizations for enrollment assistance, illustrating the sizable funding pool that essentially pays people to sign others up for subsidies【*】. These highlight the structure of pay-for-enrollment that navigators can tap into.

**Small Business Grant Writer/Advisor** -- Many small businesses and nonprofits need help finding and applying for the grants and incentives we listed, but they lack time or expertise. If you become well-versed in these opportunities, you can **offer consulting or grant-writing services** to help others get money -- and charge a fee or commission for your service. Essentially, you're monetizing the knowledge of opportunities by doing the legwork for clients.

- **Administering Authority:** Not a formal government role, but tied to all programs above. You'd be a private consultant interfacing with those programs on behalf of clients. Some programs allow fees to be paid from grant funds (for example, grants often include an allowable portion for administrative costs, which could cover a grant writer's fee). However, be mindful: for certain applications like government grants, charging contingent fees (percentage of award) is discouraged or disallowed -- better to charge flat or hourly fees.

- **Who Qualifies (Clients):** **Small businesses, startups, nonprofits, and individuals** who might be eligible for grants/credits but don't know how or have time. For instance, a restaurant owner who hears of a city grant but is intimidated by the application could hire you to prepare it. Or a homeowner wanting to maximize solar rebates could pay you for consulting on the process (though margins there might be slim). Nonprofits often seek freelance grant writers to go after foundation or government grants, and pay either per proposal or a part-time salary. Many businesses would gladly give a cut of a tax credit or incentive if someone could simplify it for them (keeping legal/ethical rules in mind).

- **Typical Earnings:** As a freelance grant writer or incentive consultant, you could charge **$50-$100+ per hour** depending on expertise, or flat fees like $1,000-$5,000 per grant application (depending on complexity). Some do a hybrid model: lower upfront fee plus a success bonus if the client wins. For example, helping a business claim a $50k tax credit -- you might charge $5k flat, which they'll see as worth it to get the remaining $45k. If you streamline multiple clients, you can earn a solid income. On contract: nonprofits often pay grant writers $30k-$80k annually part-time for writing multiple grants. There's also the route of packaging information (e.g. writing an e-book or hosting workshops about these opportunities and charging admission), which can scale earnings beyond one-on-one service. Essentially, you're getting paid for knowledge that converts to cash for others.

- **Effort Level:** **Medium/High.** You do need to deliver results to justify your fee. That means staying current on opportunities (lots of research), tailoring applications for each client, meeting deadlines, and doing sometimes tedious paperwork. It's project-based work that can be feast-or-famine. But if you enjoy research and writing, it aligns well. The better your system (templates, checklists), the more efficiently you can crank out quality proposals or claims. Some cases might be straightforward (filling a few forms for a tax incentive), others might need creative writing (a narrative for a competitive grant). You also need some marketing effort to find clients -- networking with business associations, being known in the community as the "grant guru." However, as you build success stories, referrals come and it gets easier.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Strong writing and communication skills greatly leverage this -- a compelling grant narrative can be the difference in winning funds for your client (and thus them coming back or referring others). Organizational skills let you juggle multiple deadlines. Also, knowing where to find information is key: subscribe to government mailing lists, use grant databases, attend info sessions agencies hold for potential applicants (you might even ask questions that help all your clients). Another leverage is specialization: become the go-to person for a specific type of funding (say, clean energy projects grants, or arts grants) -- you'll build deep knowledge and contacts in that niche, improving your win rate. If you have some technical skills, you could also pivot into proposal writing for larger contracts which pay even more. Over time, you might assemble a team (research assistant, junior writer) to increase capacity. In essence, scaling comes from either raising rates as you get known for high success, or handling more volume with efficiency.

- **How to Start:** Educate yourself -- perhaps even take a grant writing course or certification which lends credibility. Identify your target client base and what opportunities they might pursue. As a starting tactic, you could even offer a free initial consult (evaluate what funding a business could realistically seek) to hook clients. Then contract with clear terms: if it's an application, specify deliverables (completed forms, narratives, submission by deadline). For incentives like tax credits, if doing on contingency, ensure legality and clarity (e.g. you help a company get a credit and invoice them 10% after they receive it -- some handshake deals work, but better to have an agreement). Market through local chambers of commerce, online freelance platforms, and simply reaching out on LinkedIn. Another channel: partner with accountants or SBDC advisors -- they often know businesses that need grant help and can refer you (accountants focus on taxes, they might gladly hand off grant stuff to you). Build a portfolio by starting with a couple of smaller grant wins to showcase. Always maintain ethical standards (don't promise guaranteed success, don't write anything untrue). If you find certain programs are underutilized (like a county grant that's not getting enough applicants), that's an opportunity: you can essentially act as an agent to drum up applicants and help them apply, which the agency itself might quietly appreciate because it improves program spend. You might even get a contract from a government to provide technical assistance to applicants (some RFPs offer funding for "grant technical assistance providers" -- effectively what you do, but paid by the program instead of the applicant).

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** Many small businesses don't even know independent grant consultants exist -- they might think "either I do it myself or not at all." Conversely, many capable writers/researchers haven't thought to apply their skills in this domain of "finding free money for others." It's an odd cross of financial savvy and writing skill that isn't a common combo career in people's minds. Also, imposter syndrome: someone might know of these programs but hesitate to charge others for help because they aren't "professionals" -- truth is, even a motivated amateur can be a godsend to a business owner who hates paperwork. On the demand side, some are skeptical or unwilling to pay upfront for a maybe outcome ("what if we don't win?"). But if you can show them success likelihood or work on contingency, that barrier drops. The field isn't saturated, partly because it requires keeping up with a shifting landscape -- which for a full-time consultant is fine, but for dabblers it's daunting. Therefore, there's niche space to fill helping others navigate and claim these underutilized resources -- effectively transferring underutilization into your own utilization and profit.

- **Official Source/Citation:** (In lieu of a direct source, we cite an example scenario) The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and SBA frequently encourage small businesses to seek help with grant applications through SBDCs or consultants, acknowledging that many lack the expertise to do it alone[*[71]*](https://www.sba.gov/article/2021/may/25/sba-launches-community-navigator-pilot-program-application#:~:text=SBA%20Launches%20%24100M%20Community%20Navigator,businesses%20get%20the%20resources). This underscores the need and tacit approval for using specialized advisors. Additionally, various local economic development agencies list consultants for technical assistance on grants -- showing that it's a recognized approach (though citations may list specific firms, a generic reference suffices that this practice is known in the small business community).

**Technical Assistance Provider for Government Contracts/Programs** -- Beyond grants, governments often fund intermediaries to deliver services like training, coaching, or program implementation to target groups (small businesses, non-profits, etc.). If you have expertise in a required area, you can **secure contracts or subcontracts as a TA provider** -- effectively getting paid by the program to help others succeed in the program. For example, many federal grants include budgets for "capacity building" or "technical assistance" where consultants are hired to support grantees.

- **Administering Authority:** Depends on program -- could be federal agencies (SBA, HUD, DOE) or state/county offices that received a grant. For instance, the SBA's Community Navigator Pilot gave grants to hubs which then hired/spent on local spokes (service providers)[*[72]*](https://www.sba.gov/document/report-24-25-sbas-oversight-community-navigator-pilot-program-performance#:~:text=SBA%27s%20Oversight%20of%20the%20Community,year%20period%20of%20performance%2C). HUD often funds capacity-building through intermediaries like LISC or Enterprise, which then hire local consultants to help HUD grantees. State climate grants set aside funds for technical assistance to applicants from disadvantaged communities, meaning consultants get paid to do outreach and grant-writing assistance (like CEC's EmpowerInnovation program). Even school districts sometimes have funds to pay experts to help with implementation of new programs.

- **Who Qualifies:** **Professionals or firms with domain expertise** relevant to the program. For example, if the program is to increase energy efficiency in factories, they'll pay engineers or energy auditors to advise participants. If it's to help nonprofits with federal grants, they'll hire experienced grant managers to run workshops. Often, being certified as a small business (MBE/WBE etc.) and registered in government vendor systems is needed to get contracts. Networking with the primary grantee (like being known to a hub org) helps to get tapped. In some cases, you can proactively propose your services to a grant holder who may have budget to subcontract you.

- **Typical Earnings:** These are usually **contract-based payments or hourly consulting rates**. Government consulting rates can be $50-$150/hour depending on expertise (higher if highly specialized). A contract might be a fixed amount (say $20k for 6 months of workshops delivered, or $5k per cohort of businesses coached). If you land multiple such TA contracts, it can form a substantial income. Some might even evolve into ongoing roles (like becoming a part-time program manager for a grant-funded initiative). Payment is generally guaranteed as long as deliverables are met, since it's funded by grant money or appropriated funds (less risk of non-payment than, say, working directly for a small biz client).

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** You must deliver quality support, which could mean travel for site visits, developing curriculum, lots of client interaction. However, you are not working with the ultimate complexity of being the grant recipient dealing with compliance -- you're the helper, so less paperwork burden on you than them. You often have flexibility in approach, as long as objectives are met. The challenge may be aligning with bureaucratic processes (reporting your hours or outcomes to the program admin). But if it's your area of passion, you're basically being paid to consult those who need it. Getting the contract can be competitive -- you might need to respond to an RFP or at least submit qualifications. So some effort in marketing and proposal-writing for yourself is required.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** This is where being a subject-matter expert in an under-resourced skill pays. E.g., few people might specialize in helping rural businesses adopt e-commerce -- if a USDA grant is funding that TA, you as an e-commerce coach are golden. Leverage also comes from track record: once you've been a TA provider on one program, you're very likely to get referrals for another (agencies talk, or grant recipients move on and bring you into new projects). Also, scale: if appropriate, you could host group training which reaches many clients at once (efficient use of hours, often written into contracts). Tech can help -- maybe you deliver assistance via webinars, meaning you can serve a statewide audience from home, covering more ground than local in-person consultants (the funder likes that reach). Many programs emphasize serving underserved groups -- if you have cultural competence or bilingual skills, it's a big leverage since they need TA providers who can connect with communities. You can also hire associates to expand capacity if you have more demand than you alone can fulfill, turning it into a small firm operation. Essentially, you ride the wave of funding that's aimed at helping target populations succeed -- an ongoing priority in many fields (small biz, clean energy, education, etc.).

- **How to Get Contracts:** Monitor grant announcements in your field and see who gets them. Then network: introduce yourself to those organizations, highlight how you can help their beneficiaries. Many will openly seek contractors via postings on their websites or through professional networks (e.g. an SBA grant hub might release an RFQ for local "spoke" orgs or individuals to serve certain areas or industries). Check procurement sites (like state or city contractor portals) for RFPs containing keywords like "technical assistance" or "capacity building." Ensure you have a capability statement or resume that speaks to your expertise and any relevant past performance. Register as a vendor with government if needed (some states require in their financial system to pay you). Also, attend webinars or conferences for these programs -- often they mention needing mentors, trainers, etc. A direct approach can work: if you know a certain grant (say a city got money to support entrepreneurs) and you are a known figure in that entrepreneur community, reach out to program manager offering your help, possibly on contract. They might have budget they're grateful to allocate to someone who can get results rather than trying to do it all in-house. As always, deliver excellently on any pilot contract -- success stories and data (like "90% of businesses I coached increased revenue") make it easy for them to keep or rehire you and for others to do the same.

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** **People often overlook government as a customer for their coaching/consulting.** Many professionals focus on private clients and don't realize the public sector might pay for the same services at potentially better rates and scale. Also, those who do know may be intimidated by procurement processes or unaware when opportunities arise (since they can be buried in government websites). Smaller or newer consultants may not think they can win these -- assuming only big firms get contracts. In reality, many grants specifically want local small providers to deliver TA (it's more credible to the community). So there's a mismatch in perception. Additionally, established experts might not pursue these because grant budgets are temporary -- but if you hop from grant to grant, you can have continuity (especially since new ones keep coming). In sum, underutilization is due to lack of marketing on both sides: programs sometimes struggle to find quality TA providers, and providers don't pitch themselves. Bridging that gap is a clear opportunity to get paid by the government for being a helpful expert.

- **Official Source/Citation:** SBA Community Navigator Pilot Program overview[*[73]*](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107067#:~:text=,SBA%20data) -- mentions 51 grants given to hubs, "partnering with local organizations... to broaden access"[*[70]*](https://www.hiscox.com/blog/hispanic-small-businesses-can-benefit-community-navigator-pilot-program#:~:text=Hispanic%20small%20businesses%20can%20benefit,small%20businesses%2C%20including%20the). Many of those hubs then issued subcontracts to individuals/organizations to actually do the outreach and advising on the ground. Similarly, HUD's Section 4 Capacity Building program reports show funds going to technical assistance for nonprofits, implying consultants employed in those efforts. While not a direct citation of a contract, these illustrate that major federal initiatives include budgets for paying people to help others navigate programs, confirming the existence of this revenue channel.

**Class-Action Settlement Filing Service** -- (B2B Variant) Just as individuals can file claims for themselves, businesses often miss out on settlements (e.g., antitrust settlements for price-fixing of chemicals, or data breach settlements). There are firms that specialize in *recovering settlement money for companies* (like MCAG mentioned earlier)[*[35]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Image%3A%20ree)[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why). If you have a network in a certain industry or generally can navigate claims forms, you could act as a mini-version of these firms: **notify businesses of settlements and offer to handle the claim for a percentage**. Many companies will happily outsource this "found money" task.

- **Administering Authority:** The settlement administrators are external, but your service is private. You just ensure to follow the claims process properly for each case. There's no formal license needed; however, you might consider registering as a business and perhaps a finders agreement with clients. Ethically you should disclose they could file themselves for free (some might still prefer you do it). Some settlement forms actually ask if a third party is filing on behalf and require attestation or power of attorney -- be ready to provide those.

- **Who Qualifies (Clients):** **Any business potentially in a settlement class.** Usually mid-size companies are ideal -- small enough not to have in-house counsel tracking this, but large enough to have meaningful claims. Examples: a restaurant chain for a payment card fee settlement, a manufacturer for a price-fixed component settlement. Even local governments often are class members in big cases (like municipal buys of bonds or equipment subject to antitrust) and fail to file -- a niche could be serving school districts or city governments in recovering such funds for a fee (though some laws might bar contingency fees with public entities, so check that).

- **Typical Earnings:** Typically **10-30% of recovered amount** is charged by these services[*[39]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=How%20MCAG%20Makes%20the%20Process,Easier). If you secure a $50k payout for a client, a 20% fee nets you $10k. Volume is key -- you might handle dozens of claims across various settlements per year, each maybe a few thousand to tens of thousands. If you align with a law firm you might get referrals (some law firms don't want to bother with claims administration after a class action, so they refer clients to specialists). For individual consumer settlements, the margins are too low to bother one by one, but you could aggregate them via a web platform (though that ventures into needing scale like an app -- beyond a solo operation). Focus B2B or institutional to make it worth it.

- **Effort Level:** **Medium.** Identifying relevant settlements is ongoing work (following legal news, subscribing to class action newsletters). Then outreach -- convincing a company that "hey, you likely are owed money from X case, I can handle it" which might involve getting past gatekeepers. Then gathering their data (purchases records or whatever proof needed for claim). Filing properly by deadlines. It's administrative detail work with some sales upfront. If you streamline (standard contract, template letters, a database of known upcoming settlements), you can manage a portfolio of claims efficiently. You also must track payments to ensure you get your cut (some settlements mail check directly to class member -- you rely on client to pay you after; others allow direct pay to representative or an escrow if arranged). Trust and clear contracts help here. Legwork is worth it when claims are sizable.

- **Skill Leverage Opportunities:** Analytical skills to estimate claim value from client data -- you can tell a client "I project you'll get ~$20k from this -- it's worth your 15 minutes to let me do it." Also, leveraging tech: using a CRM to manage leads and claims, and possibly automating parts of form filling. Building relationships with trade associations -- e.g. you become known in the state grocery association as the go-to for any settlement involving food products, so they even alert members to use you. That reduces your client acquisition effort. Legal knowledge helps (though not necessary to be a lawyer) -- understanding the class definitions deeply to know which businesses are eligible that might not realize (like a hotel chain might not know they're included in an LCD price-fixing case -- you spot that and inform them). There's also the strategy of bundling claims: if multiple of your small clients together have, say, a similar claim and documentation burden, you can combine their evidence submission in one go to streamline -- though each still files separately, you handle concurrently. If trust is built, some companies might sign a standing agreement for you to handle all their settlement claims for a period, which is golden as you can automatically file for them when something arises.

- **How to Operate:** Similar to unclaimed funds finders, ensure your engagement is legal and transparent -- a simple contract that they authorize you to file and pay you X% of any recovered. Research class actions in progress: one can find them on TopClassActions or law firm sites. Identify industries affected. Do targeted outreach: send letters or emails to companies likely in the class, highlighting that money is available. Alternatively, partner with accountants of those industries -- CPAs might be happy to refer this specialized task and you could give them a referral cut (if allowed). When filing, some administrators require the claimant's signature -- you might pre-fill and send to client to sign, or get a limited power of attorney if needed. Maintain a schedule of claim deadlines so you never miss one once engaged. After claims, follow up with administrator if any issues. Then once paid, invoice client for fee (or have an agreement the settlement will pay to a joint account or escrow from which you take fee then remit rest -- but that can be complicated; simpler to trust the client, especially if it's a business with ongoing relationship). Market success: "we recovered $500k for clients last year in found settlement money" -- that will attract new clients. Ensure compliance with any class action rules (few restrictions on who can help file a claim -- just don't do anything fraudulent or against the settlement terms).

- **Why This Is Underutilized:** Many businesses just don't bother with class actions -- they toss the notice or think it's not worth the hassle, leaving money unclaimed (as earlier cited ~70% companies may not file)[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why). On the service provider side, a few big players exist but often focus on huge corporations. Smaller firms might find it not lucrative enough if not scaled. But at a moderate scale, a solo consultant could do quite well, given the numbers. The underutilization is essentially what MCAG's article pointed out: billions unclaimed because of lack of awareness or perceived complexity[*[35]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Image%3A%20ree)[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why). By bridging that, you claim a slice. The barrier is initial trust -- companies might not trust a stranger saying "I'll get you money for a cut" (sounds like maybe a scam). Overcoming that with professionalism and references is crucial. As more large settlements happen (they do, regularly), and economic times get lean, businesses will seek every dollar -- positioning yourself as the solution at that moment is key. There's latent demand that just needs activation through education and reliable service.

- **Official Source/Citation:** Managed Care Advisory Group (a firm in this space) blog[*[35]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Image%3A%20ree)[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why) -- essentially lays out the problem and that "roughly 70% of eligible companies don't file claims" and that billions are left unclaimed, which is exactly the gap a service can fill. They even outline reasons (lack of awareness, confusion, etc.)[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why) which are exactly what a facilitator addresses, taking a share for the effort[*[39]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=How%20MCAG%20Makes%20the%20Process,Easier). This validates both the need for and the acceptance of such intermediary services.

In summary, by positioning yourself as a facilitator, navigator, or intermediary, you tap into funds that others aren't accessing on their own. The entities running these programs often expect to pay someone for outreach or assistance (or at least don't forbid it), and the beneficiaries are usually grateful to receive the net benefit after your fee. It's a way to **profit while creating value** -- you make the pie bigger (more people get benefits) and take a reasonable slice for enabling that.

* * * * *

Those are numerous opportunities across categories, each underutilized and "easy" in the sense that knowledge and minimal effort unlocks value. Next, we synthesize the *top recommendations and strategies*.

Strategic Analysis
------------------

Having surveyed a wide array of programs, we now focus on how to **maximize return on time/effort** by cherry-picking the best opportunities, combining them smartly, and capitalizing on them as a service provider -- all while minding risks and rules.

### A. Best "Low Effort / High ROI" Opportunities (Top 15 Picks)

Based on potential payout relative to the effort and competition involved, here are the top 15 plays ranked for a California individual/business seeking maximum return per hour of effort:

**1. Unclaimed Property Recovery (Personal)** -- *Effort:* a few minutes of online search; *ROI:* potentially thousands of dollars if a forgotten asset is found. **California holds ~$14 billion in unclaimed assets** -- checking for your name (and relatives' names) is a no-brainer[*[1]*](http://www.comstocksmag.com/longreads/how-california-government-escheated-its-way-13-billion-peoples-money#:~:text=The%20state%E2%80%99s%20unclaimed%20property%20law,largest%20source%20of%20annual%20revenue). Filing a claim form is free and simple. Many finds may be small (~$50-$100), but occasionally people discover life insurance payouts, old stock accounts, etc., worth tens of thousands. The *time invested vs. potential return* is extremely favorable (literally minutes for possibly a windfall).

**2. IRS Unclaimed Tax Refunds** -- *Effort:* filing a past-due tax return; *ROI:* median ~$800 refund (federal) plus any state refund[*[29]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%95%20The%20Internal%20Revenue,by%20the%20April%2015%20deadline)[*[32]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=fail%20to%20file%20their%202021,84%20or%20other%20applicable%20credits). If you or someone you know didn't file in a year they had withholding or tax credits, filing now can yield free cash (with no penalties). The fact that over $1 billion is unclaimed annually in refunds underscores the high ROI for the simple act of filing a return[*[29]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%95%20The%20Internal%20Revenue,by%20the%20April%2015%20deadline). For example, a student who had summer jobs could get a few hundred back with an hour of work -- effectively a very high hourly rate.

**3. Employee Retention Credit (ERC)** -- *Effort:* moderate paperwork or paying a CPA; *ROI:* up to $26,000 per employee[*[37]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=products%20or%20services%20during%20the,period%20are%20entitled%20to%20recover). If you own a business with employees and haven't claimed ERC for 2020-21, this is huge. Many businesses qualify without realizing it. The process of amending payroll returns might take a few hours (or you can pay a specialist ~10-20% of the credit and still net 80-90%). That effort can return six or seven figures of cash from the IRS. **High dollar per hour** -- even if it takes 20 hours of gathering docs and communicating with a CPA, a $200,000 refund (~for 10 employees) means $10k per hour value.

**4. Tax Sale Excess Proceeds (If Applicable)** -- *Effort:* filling a claim and proving identity; *ROI:* potentially **tens of thousands of dollars**[*[74]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=When%20property%20is%20sold%20at,claim%20by%20Parties%20of%20Interest)[*[19]*](https://finance.saccounty.gov/Tax/Pages/ExcessProceeds-TaxSale_FAQs.aspx#:~:text=,filed). This applies if you (or family) ever lost a property to tax foreclosure. Many former owners have no idea they are owed surplus money. One claim could net as much as the entire home equity that was left after debts -- in LA County, numerous cases of excess $50k, $100k+ occur. The effort is relatively low (a form and maybe a notary). If it's you, the ROI is life-changing; if not you, maybe you know someone (you could even help them for a finder's fee).

**5. Class Action Settlement Claims** -- *Effort:* a few minutes per claim form (online); *ROI:* varies but often $50-$500 per claim, and you can do **multiple**. For an individual, keeping an eye on major class actions (e.g. data breach at a company you use, product recalls, etc.) and filing those claims can easily bring a few hundred bucks a year for minimal time. It's essentially filling out surveys for cash, except funded by legal settlements. If you systematize it (check a site like TopClassActions monthly), the hourly "wage" of this hobby can be quite high. **Example:** 4 claims in a year averaging $100 payout = $400 for maybe one hour total of reading and typing[*[35]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Image%3A%20ree)[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why).

**6. Demand Response Energy Rewards (OhmConnect et al.)** -- *Effort:* negligible after setup; *ROI:* up to a few hundred dollars/year plus lower bills. Enrolling in a program like OhmConnect means clicking a button to reduce usage when notified -- possibly earning ~$100-$300 a year【*】. That's not a huge absolute sum, but considering the "work" is basically turning off lights or letting the AC cycle for an hour, it's fantastic ROI on effort (pennies of effort for hundreds in reward). It's like getting paid to take an eco-friendly break.

**7. Guaranteed Income Pilot (if eligible)** -- *Effort:* one application; *ROI:* $6,000-$36,000 over a year or more【*】. This ranks high because if you fit a pilot's criteria (say you're a low-income parent in LA) the potential payoff ($1k/month) is huge relative to the minimal effort of applying. The catch is lottery selection, but the ROI mathematically (expected value) is still large enough to justify the short application. Essentially, one lucky "win" is the equivalent of dozens of grant applications or many extra work hours, for free.

**8. Civic Board/Commission Stipends** -- *Effort:* a few hours a month; *ROI:* ~$50-$100 per meeting[*[63]*](https://www.marincounty.gov/departments/board/boards-and-commissions/stipends-members-boards-and-commissions#:~:text=Stipends%20for%20members%20of%20boards,this%20meeting%20stipend%20is%20to). This is not high in absolute dollars, but extremely high in terms of being paid for something that's often enjoyable and networking-rich. If you attend 12 meetings a year at $75 each, that's $900/year. The effective hourly might be $25/hr for doing civic engagement that you might volunteer for anyway. And if you join 2 boards (some people do), double it. It's a "side gig" that doesn't feel like work.

**9. Cal EITC + Young Child Credit (State)** -- *Effort:* add a form to tax return; *ROI:* up to $1,000 (YCTC) + CalEITC maybe a few hundred depending on income. For a low-to-moderate income family with kids, claiming these credits on top of federal is nearly automatic once they file -- but many miss it. The ROI is huge because the marginal effort is just checking the box on state return if federal EITC was claimed. It's essentially free money that some miss by only doing federal taxes or using the wrong forms. In combo, a family could get $8k+ total refundable credits (federal + state)[*[32]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=fail%20to%20file%20their%202021,84%20or%20other%20applicable%20credits) for just filing taxes correctly -- that's potentially the highest ROI annual routine if they weren't filing before.

**10. Selling Unused Tax Credits (for those with projects)** -- *Effort:* negotiating a sale; *ROI:* tens of thousands in cash for a credit you couldn't use. For example, if you installed solar on a rental property and can't use the federal credit fully, you can now sell it (from 2023 on) for maybe ~90% of value【*】. The effort is finding a buyer (likely through a broker or platform) and doing some paperwork. The ROI is turning a "dead" tax asset into real dollars. Similarly, if you ever develop something like a short film or a historical rehab that yields state credits, selling those is a quick infusion of cash often making the difference between a profit or loss on the project. Because this often involves substantial sums (credits often $10k+), it's ranked high -- albeit specialized.

**11. Small Business Relief Grants (ARPA/Local)** -- *Effort:* a short application with documents; *ROI:* $5k-$20k grant[*[43]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Application%20period%20closed%20May%2031%2C,2023)[*[46]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Small%20Businesses). For an eligible business, that's a great return on perhaps a few hours gathering tax returns and filling a form. Many of these are one-time opportunities, but while they exist, the time-to-money ratio beats many other business activities (e.g. far easier than earning the same through extra sales). True, competition can be stiff, but many programs ended up with priorities that give decent chances if you fit (and some funds went unawarded when not enough applied). So, if you see one, jump on it. It might be the easiest few thousand you make in your business's life.

**12. Energy Efficiency Home Upgrades (using rebates/credits)** -- *Effort:* hiring a contractor and filing rebate forms; *ROI:* potentially $10k+ in combined incentives[*[32]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=fail%20to%20file%20their%202021,84%20or%20other%20applicable%20credits). This is high ROI if you planned upgrades anyway -- e.g. you spend $20k on a new HVAC and insulation, and get $10k back between federal credit and state rebates, plus lower bills. The effort is coordinating contractors and paperwork, which is minimal compared to effectively halving your costs. If you consider the "return" as money saved/received, it's thousands for a few hours of research and form-filling -- worth more than any part-time job for those hours.

**13. Research Study Participation (especially high-paying trials)** -- *Effort:* might be a few days of time; *ROI:* a few thousand dollars[*[62]*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8290991/#:~:text=Phase%20I%20trial%20compensation%3A%20How,healthy%20volunteer%20trials%20tended). If one is willing and eligible to do a safe Phase 1 clinical trial or a series of smaller studies, the effective hourly rate can be high. For instance, a 3-day inpatient study paying $2,000 equates to ~$28/hour even if you count 72 hours straight -- and much of that time you might just be relaxing (though you're stuck in a clinic). Shorter focus groups or surveys can be like $50 for an hour -- an easy $50. By selectively choosing studies that fit your schedule, you can pocket significant side income. The main cost is scheduling inconvenience or minor discomfort, which many would argue is worth the reward.

**14. Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)** -- *Effort:* new hire paperwork; *ROI:* up to $2,400 credit per hire[*[39]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=How%20MCAG%20Makes%20the%20Process,Easier) (or higher for vets). For businesses with some turnover or hiring needs, integrating this is extremely high ROI because it's just an HR form to potentially reduce taxes by thousands. If a restaurant hires 10 employees a year and 5 qualify for $2,400 credits, that's $12,000 saved for maybe 1-2 hours total of extra form processing -- an outstanding return. It's essentially being paid by the government to give someone a chance, which you'd do anyway. It ranks a bit lower only because if you don't have employees it's moot, but for those who do, it's a must-grab low-hanging fruit.

**15. Poll Worker for Elections** -- *Effort:* one very long day + training; *ROI:* ~$180 in LA[*[63]*](https://www.marincounty.gov/departments/board/boards-and-commissions/stipends-members-boards-and-commissions#:~:text=Stipends%20for%20members%20of%20boards,this%20meeting%20stipend%20is%20to). This cracks the top 15 because, while not a high hourly rate, it is a *single-day commitment* that yields a tangible sum, and many people don't realize it's paid at all. If you have a day to spare (and many people do especially if their employer gives time off for it, or if retired/student), making nearly $200 and doing civic duty is a worthwhile trade. The effective ROI is enhanced if you consider you might otherwise spend that day unpaid. Plus some counties bump pay for bilingual poll workers or troubleshooters, making it more attractive (and some smaller counties pay more like $200+). Given it's short-term and community-oriented, it edges onto the list as a respectable way to earn extra with minimal qualification needed.

*Honorable mentions:* Refundable solar credits (for non-taxable orgs who can get direct pay), which essentially give free money for doing projects; the California **Middle Class Tax Refund** that went out (one-time $350-$1,050 -- if someone hasn't claimed or updated info, they should, though by now it's largely done); and **In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) payments** if you have a disabled family member -- not mentioned earlier, but being a paid caregiver through IHSS can be seen as easy money for something one would do anyway (effort is real caregiving, but you were likely already providing it unpaid). These are situational but for those in that situation, extremely beneficial.

### B. Stackable Strategies

Many of these programs can be **layered together to multiply benefits** without interfering with each other (ensuring no double-dipping of the same exact expense unless explicitly allowed). Here are ways to stack for maximum gain:

-   **Household Stack:** A lower-income working family could combine **EITC + Cal EITC + Child Tax Credits + Young Child Credit + Guaranteed Income Pilot + utility discounts.** For example, such a family might get $5,000+ federal EITC[*[52]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=Recovery%20Rebate%20Credit%20or%20other,applicable%20credits), $500 CalEITC, $1,000 young child credit, and if lucky, $12,000 from a year of guaranteed income -- that's nearly $18k. Add in they sign up for CARE/Lifeline programs (20% utility bill savings) and maybe a one-time rental relief grant, and it's a huge supplement. These aren't mutually exclusive: guaranteed income pilots intentionally don't affect benefits, and tax credits are independent of those programs. The key is knowing to claim each piece.
-   **Small Business Power Pack:** A qualifying small business could layer **an ERC refund + a local small biz grant + tax credits for hiring + technical assistance support.** For instance, a restaurant in LA hit by COVID: they claim ERC (say $100k), get an LA recovery grant ($15k)[*[44]*](https://eog.smallbizla.org/#:~:text=Application%20period%20closed%20May%2031%2C,2023), hire a long-term unemployed person and get WOTC ($2,400), and receive free coaching from an SBA Community Navigator (no cost, but value). Separately, they might do an energy efficiency upgrade using a utility rebate and cut future costs. None of these conflict; in fact some programs encourage leveraging others. The result is a big financial boost -- tens of thousands in relief that together accelerate recovery.
-   **Energy Efficiency Triple Play:** When upgrading a property: **utility rebate + state incentive + federal tax credit + possible sale of credits.** E.g., someone installing a new heat pump water heater: they tap a $1,000 utility rebate, use the forthcoming HEEHRA rebate to cover remaining $800 (if low-income qualifies for full cost), and then claim a federal 30% credit on whatever out-of-pocket was (if any). They could also have the contractor give an instant discount by assigning them the credit (from 2024 on). For solar on an apartment building: get federal ITC (30%), a state SGIP rebate for battery, and then potentially **sell the ITC** for cash if you can't use it (transferring it for, say, 90% of value). Also if low-income area, the ITC might have an extra 10-20% bonus you still capture before sale. These layers can make projects net positive financially.
-   **Education & Training Stack:** A person seeking to skill up could use **Pell Grants (education grant) + Workforce training funds + a stipend program.** For example, an adult student could get a Pell Grant to attend community college, simultaneously receive WIOA funds or an ETP-funded program that pays for additional certifications, and maybe a stipend from a demonstration project (some cities have paid tech bootcamps for low-income students). If they have kids, add EITC during this period because income is low. Combined, they essentially get paid to learn, with grants covering tuition and providing living support. These come from different sources but complement: Pell doesn't affect WIOA, etc.
-   **Community Builder Stack:** If you're community-minded (and perhaps not aiming for high income), you can combine **stipends from multiple civic roles and pilots.** For instance, one could be on a county health advisory board ($75/meeting)[*[56]*](https://www.santacruzcountyca.gov/Government/Commissions,CommitteesAdvisoryBodies.aspx#:~:text=County%20www,vacant%20seats%2C%20please%20click), also serve as a paid poll worker on elections, and participate in a research advisory panel for a local university (some pay $25-$50 a session). Separately, if eligible, maybe you're in a UBI pilot. No rule stops you from doing all--- you might be putting in a bit of time here and there, but the cumulative cash could be a notable supplement. Essentially, you become a professional participant: attending meetings, giving feedback, doing civic duties -- each paying a small amount that adds up.
-   **Navigator-Consultant Business Stack:** For an entrepreneur, you could simultaneously **offer multiple services that get funded by different agencies.** Say you establish a community consultancy: you contract with the city to do outreach for CalFresh enrollments (earning outreach funds), at the same time you're an official Covered CA enrollment partner (getting per-enrollment fees), and you host free tax prep under a grant that perhaps pays you a coordinator stipend. You could even be a notary and get fees for notarizing documents in those processes. None of these conflict and all target the same client base (low-income community members) -- you become a one-stop shop and get paid via different channels (federal funds, state funds, nonprofit grants, small fees). This stack not only increases revenue streams but also increases your value proposition, likely attracting more volume.
-   **Disaster Relief Maximization:** In an event like COVID or a natural disaster, multiple aids pop up: one could claim **unemployment benefits (or PUA), stimulus checks, an SBA EIDL advance, rent relief, utility forgiveness, etc.** Many did this, but some thought if they got one they couldn't get others -- in reality, most were independent (except a few like PPP vs. UI double-dip rules). In COVID, savvy individuals collected stimulus ($1,200 + $600 + $1,400 over time), plus maybe $10k EIDL advance if they had a side gig, plus extra unemployment weekly top-ups, plus local rent or food assistance. The lesson: when disaster programs roll out, take advantage of *all* you're eligible for -- it's often not either/or. That stack might be once-in-a-generation, but climate disasters or future downturns could see similar layering.

The golden rule in stacking is **read the fine print**: ensure that participating in one program doesn't disqualify you from another, and that you're not counting the same expense twice unless it's explicitly allowed. For example, you can't use the exact same wage dollars to claim ERC and also have them reimbursed by a grant -- one or the other (or split them). But you could use a grant for one set of costs and ERC for payroll, simultaneously. By intelligently allocating different resources to different needs, you optimize total benefit.

California and federal programs often intentionally complement each other (state credits add to federal, local grants fill gaps in federal aid, etc.), so a strategic user can legitimately layer them for a sum greater than the parts. It requires staying organized -- perhaps maintaining a spreadsheet of what you're getting from where and any interactions -- but the payoff in financial resilience or growth is well worth it.

### C. Business Model Opportunities

Rather than just one-off personal gains, someone enterprising can build a **sustainable business or side hustle around these underutilized programs**. Here are viable models, as touched in section 5, with a strategic spin:

-   **"Money Hunter" Consulting:** Set up a service (even under a brand like "California Funds Recovery & Consulting") that covers multiple find-and-claim services: unclaimed property retrieval, class action claim filing, excess proceeds recovery, and even government refunds (help people file old tax returns). Market to individuals and small businesses: "We find money owed to you, for a 10% cut -- no upfront fee." This all-in-one approach can generate multiple revenue streams. You'd utilize public databases and legal filings to source leads. With some success stories and testimonials, this could scale -- possibly even use software to scan for client names across databases. Key differentiation: trustworthiness (bonded, references) in a field that may have charlatans. Since you only earn when clients recover, it's attractive to them. Over time, as noted, you could pivot to B2B for bigger fish or integrate with estate attorneys, etc. Essentially, you become a bounty hunter for bureaucracy-hidden money.
-   **Grant & Incentive Advisory Firm:** As mentioned, focusing on navigating the bureaucracy for clients. In California, there's a constant flow of new programs (tech grants, drought grants, etc.). You can be the expert who reads all the RFPs so businesses don't have to. As a business model, you could charge a monthly retainer to be on call for a company's "free money opportunities" -- e.g. a manufacturing company pays you to alert them and apply for any rebate, credit, or grant that could save them money (energy rebates, training funds, tax credits). Your value proposition: you essentially become their external "grant department" for far less than hiring someone. By capturing a portion of everything you bring in (or fixed fees that are justified by ROI), you turn your knowledge into a recurring revenue service. You could start solo then hire junior researchers as you grow client base.
-   **Community Benefits Navigator Organization:** Form a small business or nonprofit that contracts with government to do exactly what agencies struggle with: getting people signed up. This could be structured as a social enterprise -- you do outreach for CalFresh, Covered CA, etc., getting government reimbursements; you might also partner with hospitals or utilities who have community benefit obligations (they might fund you to enroll folks in assistance programs because it aligns with their goals). You could run this lean, using digital marketing to reach eligible populations and a small call center to assist with sign-ups. Revenue comes from multiple contracts or performance-based payments. This model fills a systemic need: governments want increased participation but can't always do the ground game -- you do it and get paid. In time, you could expand services (tax prep, legal aid referrals, etc.) with grant funding. It's basically an **aggregator of underutilized benefits** delivered by a private entity for profit + impact.
-   **Energy/Climate Incentive Facilitator:** With the huge wave of climate-related incentives, one could create a consulting niche like "GreenCash Consulting" that helps homeowners, landlords, and businesses maximize all the new rebates and credits. You'd assess their situation, create a plan ("if you install X and Y, you can get $Z from fed, $Z from state, etc."), perhaps connect them with contractors (taking a referral fee), and handle the paperwork for a fee. This is akin to a financial advisor but for incentives -- and because the landscape is complex and confusing to laypeople, many would gladly pay 5-10% of what they save. You could also help clients monetize credits (be the intermediary to find buyers for transferable credits for a cut). As the IRA programs roll out, being first in this space could capture significant business, especially among property managers or small businesses that want the upgrades but not the hassle.
-   **Training & Compliance Service for Grants:** Many organizations get grants or credits but then fear the compliance (reporting, audits). If you have admin skills, you can turn that into a service: after they win a grant (maybe you even helped them win it), you offer to manage the grant -- ensuring funds are spent right, reports filed -- for a monthly fee. This encourages more to apply (because they know they can outsource the admin). It's an adjacent business: you help them get the money and then continue earning by helping them keep it properly. In California, lots of nonprofits miss out on grants because they lack admin capacity -- you could be a fractional grant manager for several orgs at once, each paying you part of the grant's admin budget. The government essentially pays through the grant for your role, indirectly. It's a way to create a stable income that rides on the wave of increased funding flows.
-   **Multi-program Online Platform:** If tech-savvy, one could develop a website or app that personalizes all these opportunities to a user. For example, a user inputs their profile (income, household, business details) and the system outputs: "You are likely eligible for X, Y, Z -- click here for assistance." Revenue could come from referral fees (e.g. if they click to a tax prep partner for EITC, you get a cut, or a solar installer for a rebate, you get a lead fee) or government contracts (public agencies might license the platform to use with their constituents). Essentially a "benefits aggregator". There have been attempts (BenefitsCal or 211 systems) but many are government-run and clunky, so a private user-friendly version that also includes things like class actions or credits could carve a niche. If not building new tech, even a consulting practice using off-the-shelf CRM to track and follow up with clients across multiple program applications could differentiate you (like, sign up a client for free analysis, then you assist them sequentially in getting 5 different benefits, charging small fees for each or one bundle price).
-   **Asset Locator & Estate Reunification Firm:** Expand asset finding into a broader probate support service. Many times, heirs don't know about assets. You could collaborate with estate attorneys: when they handle someone's estate, you sweep for any unclaimed property or refunds due, thus increasing what heirs get (and you take a fee from the found assets). Attorneys are happy because it's added value to their client with no extra work for them. This could become routine: every estate case, your firm gets a sub-task to find "hidden money." With California's large aging population, this could be steady. Additionally, partner with corporate finance departments to find unclaimed rebates or credits in their books (like, find out if they overpaid sales tax or have vendor credits -- some firms do this already, known as AP recovery audits). By diversifying targets (individuals, estates, companies), you smooth your business flow.

In short, there's ample room to **commercialize the process of unlocking underutilized funds**. The common thread is you solve friction: whether it's paperwork, awareness, or time -- you remove the barrier between people and money that's meant for them, and you earn a portion for that service.

A critical success factor in these models is building **trust and credibility**. Since scams exist in these realms, being transparent (citing the official source of funds, not charging upfront unjustified fees, adhering to caps) will set you apart. If you deliver real dollars to clients, word spreads and your business grows. It's creating a win-win: clients get free or found money, you get legitimate income, and funding programs achieve their utilization goals.

### D. Risk & Compliance Considerations

While pursuing these opportunities, it's essential to remain aware of potential **risks, limitations, and obligations** to avoid turning "free money" into future headaches. Here are key notes of caution and best practices:

-   **Don't Commit Fraud or Falsify Information:** This should go without saying, but any attempt to claim funds you aren't eligible for by misrepresentation is illegal. For example, claiming a tax credit for which you don't qualify (like saying you have a child when you don't for EITC) is fraud and can lead to penalties, repayment, and even prosecution[*[30]*](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-than-1-billion-in-2021-tax-refunds-still-unclaimed-taxpayers-should-act-now-to-see-if-they-are-eligible#:~:text=below%20shows%20how%20many%20taxpayers,median%20refund%20in%20each%20state). Similarly, overstating lost revenue to get a larger ERC is being heavily cracked down on by the IRS now. The **rule of thumb**: only claim what you're legitimately entitled to, and keep documentation to back it up. These programs are generous; don't be tempted to stretch the truth for a bit more.
-   **Be Mindful of Tax Implications:** Many "free money" receipts are taxable. E.g., unemployment benefits, stipends from research, rewards from utility programs might be considered taxable income (the NIH states compensation $600+ is reported to IRS)[*[61]*](https://www.cc.nih.gov/recruit/crvp#:~:text=Volunteer%20Payment%20,the%20IRS%20and%20sends). Most grants to businesses are likely taxable as business income (unless specifically exempted by law, like certain COVID restaurant grants were exempt). Guaranteed income pilot payments have been considered gifts or grants (one should clarify their taxability; some pilots gave 1099s). Class action settlements: if it's a refund of something you paid, it might reduce an expense deduction instead of income; if it's punitive damages, it's taxable. Always check -- when in doubt, consult a tax professional. **Plan for possible taxes** by setting aside a portion of unexpected funds until you know their tax status.
-   **Benefit Cliffs and Interactions:** If you receive certain need-based benefits (Medi-Cal, CalFresh, housing assistance), suddenly getting cash -- like a pilot income or a big tax refund -- could affect your eligibility. Many programs tried to structure as not counting against benefits (for example, most guaranteed income pilots do not count as income for CalFresh by state waivers). But one should verify. E.g., a $12k windfall might disqualify you from a month of Medi-Cal if not handled properly. Some strategies: time the receipt (if you can control it) to avoid crossing annual recertification, or spend down the asset on exempt resources. For SSI (Supplemental Security Income), even small extra income can reduce benefits dollar-for-dollar; be cautious (one-time tax refunds don't count as income for SSI, but if you still have the cash after 12 months, it counts as a resource). So **research each benefit's rules** or talk to a benefits planner when combining multiple aids.
-   **One-time vs. Sustainable:** Many underutilized opportunities are one-offs (like you claim unclaimed property once; you get a COVID grant once). Don't build a lifestyle that relies on these windfalls regularly. Use them to pay off debt, invest, or other one-time uses rather than assuming it'll be there next year. On the business model side, if you create a consulting service around a particular funding stream, be ready to pivot when that program ends or changes. In short, treat it as bonus, not guaranteed income (unless it's something stable like a recurring tax credit you qualify for each year, then plan accordingly but also monitor law changes).
-   **Reporting and Audit Trails:** If you receive grants, especially as a business or nonprofit, expect to document how you used them. Many grants require final reports or have audits. Even something like ERC -- the IRS can audit your payroll records to ensure you really had the drop in revenue or paid those employees. Keep all supporting documents for at least the statute of limitations (often 3-4 years, but for unclaimed property claims, keep proof you were entitled in case any dispute arises). For energy rebates, sometimes inspections are done to verify installation. **Compliance is part of the deal** for "free" money: read the fine print and fulfill any requirements (like attending a workshop, or not selling an EV you got a rebate on for X years, etc.). Non-compliance can lead to clawbacks (you having to pay the money back). For instance, if a business took an SBA grant agreeing to maintain certain employment and then didn't, they might owe some back -- those terms are spelled out, so be aware.
-   **Caps and Lifetime Limits:** Some benefits have lifetime limits or one-per-person rules. E.g., the first-time homebuyer credit (federal, old program) could only be claimed once. Some state credits have lifetime caps per taxpayer. California's college savings grant (Middle Class Scholarship) you can only get certain years. Know if you've already utilized something and avoid trying to double-claim. Similarly, some rebates (like EV rebates in CA) limit how many times one individual can get them (to prevent, say, flipping cars just for rebates). Make sure you're eligible anew if you try to claim a second time. Also, stacking has limits: if you get multiple incentives for one purchase, one might reduce the other (for example, if a utility rebate already reduced the cost, your tax credit might be on the net cost only). Plan for those adjustments to not accidentally over-claim.
-   **Opportunity Cost of Time:** While we tout high ROI, keep perspective: don't spend 50 hours chasing a $100 payout. Some folks get caught up in extreme couponing of benefits. The programs listed are selected for good payoff, but if circumstances change (say a program becomes highly competitive or burdensome), re-evaluate if it's worth your time. Your hour might be better spent on your core business than on a marginal grant. For instance, writing a 40-page grant proposal for a $5k grant might not be worthwhile unless it's also building capacity for bigger ones. Always consider the value of your time and sanity -- "free money" might not be free if it causes undue stress or time that could be making money elsewhere.
-   **Licensing and Legalities for Service Providers:** If you start monetizing these processes (like being an asset finder or tax credit consultant), ensure you have any required licenses (e.g., private investigator license in states that require it for asset recovery, or at least a registered business and possibly bond/insurance). If working on taxes or financials, consider becoming an Enrolled Agent or CPA for credibility (though not strictly required for all tasks, it can help). For navigator roles, adhere to program ethics (like you can't charge clients for Covered California enrollment assistance -- it's funded by the program; your pay comes from the program, not the client). Similarly, in helping with benefits, there are privacy laws (don't misuse client data, follow HIPAA if dealing with health info, etc.).
-   **Avoiding Scams and Predatory Practices:** Ironically, while you may help others avoid scams, you yourself should be cautious. There are unscrupulous actors for ERC (promoters making businesses file bogus claims -- IRS warns about this)[*[39]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=How%20MCAG%20Makes%20the%20Process,Easier). Don't partner with shady outfits that promise the moon and take huge cuts or put clients at risk. For example, some ERC firms took 30% and left clients holding the bag for ineligible claims -- if you're going to outsource help, vet them (the IRS OIG noted issues with some third-party filings). If you're the service provider, ensure your fees are reasonable and within legal limits, and that you present yourself clearly as independent (not a government rep, unless you are under contract to act on government's behalf like a certified navigator). Transparency builds trust and keeps you out of legal hot water (some states have laws against charging upfront for certain recovery services -- follow those).
-   **Clawback and Retention Clauses:** Some grants or credits have conditions where if you don't maintain something for a period, you might have to repay. E.g., California Competes tax credit (not covered but an example) requires meeting employment milestones for several years -- fail and credit is recaptured. Or a homebuyer grant might require you live in the home 5 years. Always read award documents -- know how long you're committing. If you take a guaranteed income pilot money, is it considered a loan if you move out of area? (Usually not, but check). Comply fully to avoid any demand for return. The risk is usually low if you simply do what you said you would, but life happens, so if something changes, communicate with the program -- sometimes they waive clawbacks in hardship situations (e.g., you got a facade improvement grant that required 5-year business operation but you had to close in year 3 due to reasons -- they might not claw it all back, or only a pro-rated portion).
-   **Impact on Credit or Benefits:** A nuance -- if you receive a large sum (like $20k from unclaimed property), depositing it could raise flags if you're on certain income-based programs or if you have debt in collections (sudden bank balance might tempt creditors to garnish, though typically they'd need a judgment and levy for that). Also, it could affect financial aid calculations for students (a one-time income might affect FAFSA if it's counted as income). Plan timing and usage: if you have known sensitive timelines (like applying for college aid, or nearing the end of bankruptcy process), consult an advisor on how to handle incoming money. Possibly delaying receipt or spending down on exempt assets could be strategies.
-   **Ethical Use and Mission Drift:** Particularly for those turning these into businesses -- remember that these programs exist to help those in need or to further certain public goals. If you find yourself gaming the system too aggressively (even legally), consider the ethics and long-term effects. For example, signing up just to get a pilot's money when you don't actually need it deprives someone who does (though "need" is subjective, pilots use random selection precisely to avoid judgement here). Or as a consultant, don't encourage clients to do something not in their best interest just because it yields you a fee. Maintaining integrity ensures the longevity of both your business and the programs (if programs get abused or only help those gaming them, political support can wane).

In conclusion, **due diligence and integrity** are the watchwords. California's regulatory environment can be strict, but also transparent -- use that to your advantage by reading official guidelines (we've cited many)[*[9]*](https://da.lacounty.gov/community/fraud-alerts/scammers-take-portion-of-unclaimed-property#:~:text=TIPS%3A)[*[36]*](https://www.mcaginc.com/post/the-true-cost-of-unclaimed-settlements-are-you-leaving-money-on-the-table#:~:text=Despite%20this%20opportunity%2C%20estimates%20suggest,Why). When in doubt, ask program administrators -- they often will clarify rules (they want participation but proper participation). The opportunities are abundant and largely safe/legal; just steer clear of pitfalls by staying informed and honest.

By maximizing legitimate benefits, stacking wisely, building service models, and minding compliance, one can significantly improve financial outcomes without stepping outside legal or ethical bounds -- truly embodying the idea of working smarter, not harder, with the system on your side.
