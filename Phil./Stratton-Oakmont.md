Stratton Oakmont Sales Training Manual – Key Lessons for Executive Recruiting

Summary: This document distills the core principles and techniques from the Stratton Oakmont training manual and adapts them for a professional in executive recruiting or headhunting sales. It covers the mindset and motivation needed for success, effective prospecting and qualifying strategies, phone scripts and objection-handling (rephrased for recruiting contexts), closing techniques, and the disciplined habits and terminology that top recruiters can apply in their daily workflow. The tone is professional and objective, focusing on actionable guidance that can replace a full reading of the manual.

Success Mindset and Attitude

A strong, positive mindset forms the foundation of all high-level sales success. The Stratton manual emphasizes that believing in yourself and maintaining an optimistic, persistent attitude are non-negotiable for a salesperson. Key mindset principles include:

Unshakeable Belief and Confidence: Top performers **“believe in [themselves] and act as though it were impossible to fail”**. Cultivate a well-earned confidence in your abilities. Trust that you are destined for success through effort and skill. In practice, this means projecting confidence on calls and in meetings – clients and candidates can sense self-belief in your tone and demeanor.

Positive Mental Attitude: Eliminate negative thoughts and replace them with positive ones. The manual stresses that if you don’t believe a goal is possible, you will prove yourself right by never achieving it. Setbacks are normal; instead of getting discouraged, view problems as challenges and learning opportunities on the way to success. Tip: Surround yourself with positive influences and avoid the “viruses” of anger, envy, or defeatism that can derail your motivation.

Persistence and Resilience: “Persistence and determination together are omnipotent” – you only fail when you quit. The Stratton culture ingrained that winners persevere through obstacles and keep fighting in the face of rejection. For a recruiter, this means not being discouraged by unanswered calls, rejections from candidates, or clients saying “no.” Every “no” is just one step closer to a “yes.” Maintain the discipline to bounce back immediately from setbacks and keep dialing the next number or pursuing the next lead.

High Energy and Enthusiasm: Approach each day with enthusiasm and a mindset that each call is a new opportunity. The manual notes that our thoughts directly affect our physical state and results – *“your thoughts can make you sick or release endorphins…which cause elation”*. In other words, an enthusiastic attitude is infectious and helps you perform at your best. Engage your prospects with energy. Smile while talking (even on the phone) and let your genuine excitement show in your voice; this builds rapport and trust.


By adopting this winning mindset, an executive recruiter sets the stage for success. **“Successful people are ordinary people with extraordinary determination”** – internalize that determination, confidence, and positivity every day before you pick up the phone.

Goal Setting and Personal Motivation

Stratton Oakmont’s training heavily emphasizes the importance of clear goals and intense personal motivation. In recruiting, as in any sales-driven field, you need a target to aim for and a plan to get there:

Definite Goals and Plans: Have a “definite major purpose” – a specific, measurable goal for your life or career. It’s not enough to say “I want to bill a lot” or “I want to be successful.” Define your goals clearly (e.g., “Place 10 candidates this quarter” or “Bill $500k in fees this year”) and write them down. The Stratton manual (drawing on Napoleon Hill’s success principles) advises writing down your major goal and reading it every day. This keeps your definite purpose sharp in your mind and guides your daily choices.

“Battle Plan” and Tracking: For each goal, create a concrete action plan – the manual calls it a well-thought-out battle plan pursued with persistence, self-sacrifice, and discipline. Break big goals into monthly, weekly, and daily targets. For example, if your goal is 5 new client contracts this month, plan how many outreach calls that requires per week, and per day. Review your plan constantly: top performers “have clearly defined game plans which they review constantly. They know where they are going every day, every month and every year – things don’t just happen, they make them happen”. In practice, start each day reviewing your targets (calls, emails, meetings) and end each day by measuring your progress.

Visualize and Self-Motivate: The training manual encourages visualizing success and using it as fuel: “picture in your mind’s eye the rewards of success” to keep your engine burning. In recruiting, you might visualize closing a big placement or signing a major client and imagine the tangible rewards (commission, praise, career advancement) as well as intangible (pride of achievement). This mental technique builds motivation. Positive affirmations can help too – for example, telling yourself “I will connect three great candidates with great opportunities today” reinforces a proactive mindset. The Stratton culture even provided daily affirmations for brokers to repeat, like “I feel terrific,” to cultivate a can-do mental state.

Avoid Complacency – Keep Raising the Bar: When you do hit a goal, celebrate briefly but then set a new goal. The manual notes that winners don’t rest for long on their laurels – they “raise the stakes” and keep striving for the next level. In practice, if you just closed a big deal or had a record quarter, enjoy the win but quickly refocus on what’s next (e.g., aiming to double placements, or tackle a new niche). Continuously aiming higher ensures ongoing growth.


In summary, set specific goals, make detailed plans, and stay passionately committed. Know exactly what you’re working towards each day. This clarity of purpose will drive you through the hard work needed to succeed in executive recruiting.

Prospecting and Lead Qualification

The Stratton Oakmont manual teaches that time is a salesperson’s most precious asset, and focusing on qualified prospects is crucial. In recruiting terms, this means prioritizing the right clients and candidates so you invest your efforts wisely. Key lessons on prospecting and qualifying include:

Target “Qualified” Prospects: A qualified prospect is someone who has the need, capacity, and openness to do business with you. The Stratton definition of a “qualified investor” was very specific (e.g. $100K+ in investable assets and at least some interest in investing). For a recruiter, think in parallel terms:

A qualified client might be a hiring manager or company with active or imminent hiring needs, the budget to use your services, and the authority to make hiring decisions.

A qualified candidate might be an executive with the right skill set and experience for your market, a level of interest or pain point that makes them open to new opportunities, and the ability to relocate or make a job change in a reasonable timeframe.


The manual’s warning is to avoid “weak qualifications,” because they become *“major roadblocks on your road to success”* – in other words, chasing unqualified leads wastes time and erodes your confidence as a closer. For example, repeatedly calling a company that never uses external recruiters, or a candidate who is clearly not willing to move, will only frustrate you. Instead, spend that time finding better prospects.

Qualify Early: Stratton brokers were trained to ask a series of qualifying questions at the very start of a relationship, before investing time in a full pitch. In recruiting, your initial conversation (or even a pre-call research) should determine if the prospect is worth pursuing:

For a new client, you might ask: “Are you currently looking to hire for any leadership roles?”; “Have you worked with executive search firms before?”; “If the right candidate came along, do you have headcount and budget approval to bring them on?” These are analogous to Stratton’s questions about investment preferences and capital – they reveal how able and ready the prospect is.

For a candidate, you might ask: “Would you be open to discussing a new opportunity if it was clearly a step up for you?”; “What would be your ideal next career move in terms of role or industry?”; “Do you have any constraints that would prevent a job change in the near future?”


The goal is to gather key information quickly, so you don’t “waste [the prospect’s] time with something not suitable” – or waste your own time. In the Stratton script, brokers asked investors about their preferences (big stocks vs. small, domestic vs. international), risk appetite, investment horizon, and a “ballpark” figure of assets to invest. A recruiter should similarly identify the prospect’s needs, timeframe, decision-making process, and stakes early on.

Criteria for a Strong Lead: Stratton’s manual suggests specific data points that “benefit both the broker and the prospect” in assessing a lead. Translated to recruiting:

Need Area: What field or specialization is the prospect interested in? (E.g., an investor’s interest in certain industries parallels a client’s need for candidates in specific functions or a candidate’s interest in certain roles.)

Level of Urgency: Is the need immediate or long-term? (Similar to short-term vs. long-term investment outlook – a client hiring now is more urgent than one merely “considering future hires.”)

Risk Tolerance / Openness: How open is the person to something new or different? (Stratton asked if investors were *“aggressive or conservative”*; in recruiting, this could gauge how open a client is to an unconventional candidate, or how willing a candidate is to take a bold career move.)

Capacity: Does the prospect have the means? (For clients: budget for the hire or to pay your fee; for candidates: family support or mobility if relocation is needed, etc. In Stratton’s terms, ensuring liquid capital was available.)

Recent Actions: Stratton brokers even asked what stocks the prospect recently bought. A recruiter might ask a client what hiring they’ve done lately or ask a candidate if they’ve entertained other job offers – this context is invaluable for qualification.


Don’t Chase “Bad” Leads: Perhaps one of the hardest skills is learning to disqualify leads that aren’t going anywhere. The manual is blunt: *“you don’t have time for information seekers and individuals not interested or in position to open [an account]”*. In our context, that means politely parting ways with prospects who are “just shopping around” or who lack decision authority. It’s better to have a smaller pipeline of truly viable prospects than a huge list of unqualified ones. This frees you to focus on high-probability opportunities.


In short, know what a good prospect looks like for your business, and rigorously qualify every lead against that standard. Stratton trainees were taught that *“the road to riches starts with the correct qualification”* – for a recruiter, the road to consistent placements and billings does too.

Phone Script Structure and Communication Techniques

Much of Stratton Oakmont’s success came from a well-honed phone approach. They operated as a “dialing culture,” meaning brokers perfected what to say, how to say it, and how to control a call. An executive recruiter can apply these same communication techniques when cold-calling potential clients or candidates:

Professional, Confident Opening: Always begin calls by introducing yourself and your firm clearly and politely. Stratton’s script started with: *“Hello, Mr. __, [Your Name] from Stratton Oakmont in New York. How are you today?”*. The tone is friendly but businesslike. In recruiting, you might say, for example: “Hello Mr. Smith, this is Jane Doe from XYZ Executive Search. I hope you’re doing well.” Using the prospect’s name and your full name/company establishes transparency and confidence. Immediately afterward, get to the point quickly – acknowledge that you know they are busy and you will be brief. This shows respect for their time and positions you as a professional who won’t waste it.

Establish Context and Credibility: If possible, reference a context that warms up the call. The Stratton manual suggests asking if they are familiar with your firm; in a recruiting call you might mention a referral or a relevant industry fact: e.g., “We specialize in placing CFOs in the healthcare industry” (if speaking to a CFO), or “We were recommended to you by John Doe” if you have a referral. In the Stratton script, after introducing themselves, brokers would often say *“we specialize in both foreign and domestic special situations… things of that nature”* to give a quick credibility statement. Do the equivalent in recruiting: give the prospect a reason to keep listening by highlighting your niche expertise or a unique value. For example: “My firm focuses exclusively on executive placements in fintech – we’ve helped companies like ABC and DEF find top talent.” This mirrors Stratton’s positioning as a “boutique investment banking firm making only a handful of recommendations a year” to distinguish themselves from generic stockbrokers.

Purpose and Permission (“The Hook”): One of the brilliant techniques in the Stratton script is how they frame the call as low-pressure: *“With your permission, all I would like to do is introduce myself and my firm, forward you a complimentary issue of our monthly research report and at a later date, perhaps get back to you with our latest recommendation. Fair enough?”*. This one line does a lot of work: it sets a modest goal (just sending information, not selling anything today), and ends with a gentle ask (“Fair enough?”). For recruiters, a comparable hook could be: “All I’d like to do today, with your permission, is introduce myself and learn a bit about your needs. If it makes sense, I can send you a brief profile of our services and, at a later date, perhaps share an outstanding candidate or opportunity with you – fair enough?” This approach lowers the prospect’s defenses. You’re making it easy for them to say “yes” because you are not immediately pitching a product or demanding a commitment – you’re just opening the door. Always end this part with a light close-question like Stratton’s “fair enough?” or “is that okay?” to secure agreement to continue. This small yes early on sets a positive tone.

Use a Script but Sound Natural: Stratton trainees memorized their phone scripts, but the manual reminds them to **“sound like you’re speaking extemporaneously”**. This means avoid reading in a monotone. Practice your talking points so well that they roll off conversationally. Vary your tone and pace to keep it engaging. In a recruiting call, you might have notes on key points (introduction, your hook, a couple of qualifying questions), but you want the dialogue to feel personable, not like a robotic telemarketer. Tip: One way to achieve this is by actively listening and reacting in the moment. The manual advises: *“listen to what the man says – be a good listener”*. If the prospect mentions something (e.g., “we’re not hiring right now because we just merged with another company”), acknowledge it and show you heard them before moving on. A script is a guide, not a straightjacket – stick to the key framework but adapt to the conversation’s flow.

Focus on the Prospect (Not Yourself): Another classic sales principle reinforced by the manual is to engage the prospect by focusing on their interests. For instance, Stratton brokers would ask a prospect about their investment experience and preferences as soon as permission was granted. Similarly, a recruiter should ask the client or candidate about their situation early in the call (after the introduction and hook). Examples: “To ensure I don’t waste your time, could I ask a couple of quick questions about your current talent needs?” or for a candidate: “I’d love to learn about your career goals so I only reach out with relevant opportunities – may I ask a few questions?” This makes the interaction a two-way street and shows you value their time by tailoring your approach. It also shifts the call from a monologue to a dialogue, which builds rapport.

Match Your Prospect’s Energy: The Stratton manual even delves into maintaining the right energy on the phone, noting that if the prospect is “up” (in a positive or energetic mood) and you sound “down” (flat or unenthusiastic), or vice versa, the conversation will not connect. Ideally, “if he’s up and you’re up – the conversation is up.” The lesson: be enthusiastic, but also mirror the prospect’s tone to a degree. If the person sounds all business and serious, don’t overdo jokes or small talk – remain upbeat but get to the point. If the person is friendly and chatty, take a moment to build rapport on a human level (find a common interest or casual ice-breaker). The manual specifically encourages finding something in common – “an event, a child, a common interest” – to establish rapport as the conversation progresses. In a recruiting scenario, this could mean referencing a shared industry trend (“I noticed the panel you spoke on about supply chain issues – wasn’t that a great discussion?”) or even local weather or sports if appropriate, to create a bit of warmth. Just be sure to keep rapport-building brief and then steer back to your objective for the call.

Clear, Jargon-Free Language: Speak in plain business language and avoid overly technical terms or “inside baseball” talk that the other person might not understand. Stratton’s script was straightforward and avoided confusing financial jargon when introducing their firm (they mentioned broad terms like special situations, IPOs, etc., but nothing overly complex in the first call). For recruiters, this means explaining your value proposition in layman’s terms (e.g., “We help companies like yours find and attract top-performing executives”) rather than internal jargon (“We have a great ATS and talent sourcing methodology,” which might not mean much to a layperson). Save technical details for later in the process; on initial contact, simplicity and clarity win trust.


In essence, have a structured game plan for your calls: a confident intro, a credibility statement, a low-pressure hook asking permission, and then engage the prospect with questions. Stick to this structure (the “program,” as the manual calls it) every time, and you’ll develop a consistent rhythm. As Stratton’s training shows, when you execute a call well and stick to the script while sounding unscripted, your effectiveness on the phone will soar.

Handling Objections and Rebuttals

In any kind of sales – including selling job opportunities or recruiting services – you will face objections. These are the reflex responses or concerns prospects use to brush you off (“I’m not interested,” “We’re happy with our current vendors,” etc.). The Stratton Oakmont manual put heavy focus on expertly handling objections with prepared rebuttals, and many of these techniques are highly transferable to recruiting. Key strategies include:

Always Stay Calm and Empathetic: The first rule the manual conveys is never to get rattled or argue with a prospect. Never be discourteous, even if the prospect or their gatekeeper is rude. Instead, acknowledge the objection sincerely. For example, if a client says “I’m not interested,” a Stratton broker would respond, “I understand that you’re not interested – believe me, I didn’t expect you to be from a single phone call” (empathizing with their skepticism). This disarms the situation. In recruiting, if a candidate says “I’m happy where I am,” you might reply, “I completely understand – and I wouldn’t expect you to leap at a random call. I know you must get these calls often and it can be a bother.” Show them you get their perspective. This empathy builds a connection rather than contention.

Use the Acknowledgment + Value + Close Formula: Stratton’s rebuttals often followed a pattern: acknowledge the objection, provide a quick value point or solution, and then close by asking for a small commitment. For example:

Objection: “I get too many calls like this.” Rebuttal in manual: “I’m sure you get bombarded with calls, and I hope you can tell the good from the bad. Stratton Oakmont is a boutique firm making only a handful of recommendations a year. At this point, I’m only hoping to introduce myself and get back to you with our next major idea – I’m not trying to sell anything today.” Then a gentle close: *“Fair enough?”*. The structure is clear: validate their feeling of being inundated, then differentiate yourself (we’re different and valuable), then ask for permission to continue.

For a recruiting adaptation: if a client says, “We’re already using other recruiters,” you might respond: “Absolutely, I figured you might be. And I’m not here to disrupt any relationships that are working – in fact, most of my clients also work with multiple firms. My firm is a bit different in that we specialize in this niche and only take on a few select searches at a time, ensuring high-touch service. All I’m asking is to be able to share one or two stellar candidate profiles with you when we come across talent that could truly be a fit. If they don’t impress you, you’ll never have to hear from me again. Is that fair?” This mirrors Stratton’s “we’re not looking to interfere… most of our clients have 2 or 3 [brokers]… if you like [the idea], perhaps we do business; if not, you never hear from me again” approach, adapted to recruiting. You calmly address the concern (not replacing their current brokers), highlight your value (specialized, selective), and give a no-risk option (just look at a candidate, if it’s not a fit, no harm done).


Common Objections and Responses: The manual provided a list of frequent objections and sample rebuttals. Here are several, with recruiting translations:

“Not interested” / “Not looking” – The manual’s approach: acknowledge (“I understand you’re not interested; believe me, I didn’t expect you to jump on board from a 30-second call”) and then propose sending information or having a future chat instead of pushing now. For a candidate who says they’re not looking, you could say: “Of course – you’re a successful [Role], so you’re likely well taken care of. I’m not asking you to consider a change on the spot. I’d just like to send you a brief overview of an opportunity that could be a game-changer for your career. If it doesn’t intrigue you, no problem – we can part as friends. Does that sound okay?” The key is to remove immediate pressure while keeping the door open.

“I have a trusted partner already” – Manual’s “happy with my broker” rebuttal: *“That’s great, believe me, we’re not looking to run your portfolio… no one firm has a monopoly on ideas”*. Adaptation for recruiting: If a client says they love their current recruiting firm or internal HR team, respond: “I’m happy to hear you have good help – I’m not here to replace them. Like investments, no one source has a monopoly on top talent. All I ask is to be an additional resource for you. When I come across an outstanding candidate who could make a real impact on your business, I’d love to have your ear. If you’re 100% satisfied with your team’s candidates, I completely respect that, but it wouldn’t hurt for you to see one more strong option. Is that reasonable?” This way, you position yourself as a complement, not a competitor, echoing the manual’s advice to say *“we are not looking to change those relationships, but simply complement them”*.

“No time, I’m busy” – Manual’s guidance: if the prospect says they’re busy or in a meeting, a Stratton broker would acknowledge and then get straight to the point. For instance: “I understand you’re in the middle of something – I’ll be extremely brief. The reason I called is…” followed by a one-sentence hook. For a recruiter, if a prospect tries to cut you off due to time, you might quickly say: “I know you’re busy, so I’ll make this 20 seconds. The only reason I called was to ask if you might consider a top 1% candidate in [field] if they were available. If now is a bad time, I can follow up later with an email.” Often this intrigues them enough to continue for a moment despite being busy. The manual suggests that showing respect for their schedule but still swiftly delivering your key message can buy you precious extra seconds on the call.

“Send me information” – Sometimes a prospect brushes off a call by asking for literature. Stratton’s whole qualifying call is essentially built around offering to send information as a door-opener, so their brokers would readily agree and use that as a reason to follow up. In recruiting, if a client says “email me your info,” treat it as a positive sign of interest. Respond enthusiastically: “Certainly. I will email you my information and some brief case studies of successful placements we’ve done in your industry. I’ll include my contact details – and would it be alright if I reach out next week after you’ve had a chance to review, just to get your thoughts?” This way you secure a follow-up interaction, rather than letting the “send info” request end the conversation. (Stratton brokers always tried to schedule that next call – e.g., *“I will call you back to discuss our next recommendation”* – do the same by setting a follow-up expectation.)


When to Cut Your Losses: Not every prospect can be saved with a rebuttal. The manual acknowledges, for instance, situations like hostile prospects or hang-ups. In such cases, the instruction was to apologize, promise removal from the list, and move on. For recruiters: if someone is outright hostile or completely disengaged, it’s okay to gracefully exit. Example: “I’m sorry to have bothered you. I will not call again.” End politely. Also, Stratton trainees were told to mark these leads (e.g., with an “H” for hostile or “D” for disconnected) and remove them from future dialing lists. In your practice, keep notes in your CRM about who not to contact, or set a reminder far in the future. Spending emotional energy trying to convert a truly hostile prospect is not productive.

Practice and Preparation: A hallmark of Stratton’s training was rehearsing objections and answers so that brokers responded instantly and smoothly. Likewise, prepare and even script out your own answers to common recruiting objections. Role-play with colleagues: one plays the skeptical client, the other the recruiter handling it. The more you practice, the more natural and confident your responses will be when the real objections hit. This preparedness also prevents panic – you’ll be less likely to freeze or take offense at a rejection when you have a game plan for handling it.


Remember, the goal of rebuttals in the first call is usually not to close a sale on the spot, but to keep the conversation alive and secure a next step. Every objection handled is an opportunity to advance the relationship slightly further. As the Stratton manual puts it, you want to earn just a small “vote of confidence” from the prospect to continue the dialogue. In executive recruiting, that vote of confidence might be permission to send a candidate résumé, an agreement to a short meeting, or simply the prospect’s okay to talk again in the future. Handle objections with empathy, confidence, and persuasive value statements, and you’ll win those small commitments that eventually lead to big wins.

Closing the Deal and Following Up

Closing in the context of Stratton Oakmont often meant getting a commitment for a second call or eventually an investment. In recruiting, “closing” can mean two things: closing the client (securing a contract or job order) and closing the candidate (getting them to accept an offer). The manual’s principles on closing and follow-up apply to both:

Always Be Closing (Each Call Has a Goal): Every interaction should end with a “close” – not necessarily a monetary transaction, but a clear next step or commitment. The Stratton qualifying call, for example, closed with the broker saying “please remember the name Stratton Oakmont… All I ask is that when I call you back, you give me the same time and courtesy you gave me today to discuss what we feel has the potential to make a dynamic impact” on you. That was a close on a future meeting. Likewise, never end a call or meeting without a defined next step. If you’re speaking to a client for the first time, the close might be: “When may I call you next week to present a short list of candidates?” or “Could we set up a follow-up meeting with your HR team to discuss this further?” If you’re dealing with a candidate, the close could be scheduling the next interview or asking for commitment to move forward in the process. Even a quick cold call should end with something actionable: an agreed time for a follow-up call, permission to send information (and a scheduled time to discuss it), etc. Being disciplined about always closing on something keeps the momentum moving. It’s about gaining incremental commitments that lead to the final result.

Assume the Next Conversation: A technique used by Stratton (and many sales orgs) is to speak confidently about the future as if the prospect has already agreed. For example, *“When I call you back, I will share an idea that could double your investment”* – this presumes the call-back will happen. You can do this in recruiting: “Next week, I’ll plan to send you the profile of a candidate who I think could be a great fit, and we can go from there.” This isn’t pushy if phrased politely; it signals optimism and forward movement, which often leads the prospect to go along with the plan. Always follow this up by actually confirming a time or asking, “Does that sound good?” to lock in their agreement.

Closing the Placement: When it does come time to close the ultimate deal (a client signing your contract or a candidate accepting an offer), the manual’s ethos of confidence and persistence still applies. By this stage, if you have followed the process, you’ve built trust. Address any final objections head-on (e.g., if a client hesitates on fee, reiterate the value and maybe offer a success guarantee; if a candidate is nervous about changing jobs, remind them of their own stated career goals and how this move aligns with them). Then ask for the business directly: “Shall we move forward with the agreement?” or “Are you ready to accept the offer and start the next chapter of your career?” Never be afraid to actually ask for the close – many deals are lost because the salesperson/recruiter didn’t clearly ask for commitment when the time was right.

Urgency and “Fear of Loss”: One closing technique implied in Stratton culture is creating a sense of urgency (they often pitched hot IPOs that would be gone if the client didn’t act). In recruiting, you can ethically use a bit of urgency to prompt action. For clients, you might say: “This candidate is in high demand; I wouldn’t want you to miss the chance to speak with them.” For candidates, perhaps: “The company is looking to make a decision by next week. I want to make sure you have the opportunity to put your hat in the ring if you’re interested.” This taps into the psychology of fear of loss – people act when they feel they might lose an opportunity. Use this sparingly and truthfully (only when there is genuine time sensitivity or competition), but it can help nudge a prospect to commit.

Diligent Follow-Up: The deal isn’t done until it’s done – and even then, relationships need nurturing. Stratton training insists on immediate follow-up: *“Follow up immediately. Take action as soon as you hang up. Fax something or send a thank-you…”*. In modern terms, send a follow-up email the same day summarizing any agreements or next steps. After a call with a client, you might email a thank-you note and perhaps a recap of key points (“As discussed, I will send over two candidate profiles by Friday.”). After speaking with a candidate, send along any promised information (job descriptions, company info) promptly. This level of responsiveness shows professionalism and builds trust – it “proves” you will do what you say. The manual also encourages using thank-you notes; a brief thank-you after an interview or meeting, whether email or even handwritten, can leave a lasting positive impression.

Persistent but Professional Follow-Through: Closing often requires multiple touches. The manual noted that a prospect may be in the midst of “1000 things” and might avoid you like the plague if you try to close too quickly. The solution is polite persistence. If someone agreed to a follow-up call, make that call at the scheduled time. If they don’t answer, leave a courteous message and try again later. Keep your pipeline notes organized (who needs a follow-up when) so no hot prospect falls through the cracks. However, always combine persistence with respect – as the manual’s ethos suggests, remain professionally courteous in every interaction (never push so hard that you become a pest or come across as desperate).


By structuring each interaction with a close in mind and executing timely follow-ups, you ensure that promising leads progress toward an actual placement. A recruiter who is prompt and reliable in follow-up stands out. In summary: close on the next step at every stage, and then deliver on what you promised in that next step. This builds a momentum that carries clients and candidates through to a final agreement.

Daily Discipline and High-Performance Habits

A recurring theme in the Stratton Oakmont manual is an almost fanatical emphasis on work ethic, discipline, and managing your daily activities. Success in recruiting sales isn’t just about what you do on one great call – it’s about the consistent habits practiced every day. Here are the most important discipline and productivity lessons from the manual:

Outwork Everyone – Activity is Key: The manual recounts how top performers “would make 75 to 100 cold calls a day” and never let rejection slow them down. While the number may vary in recruiting (quality conversations can be more important than dials alone), the principle stands: talk to lots of people. Stratton guidance suggests speaking to 50 people a day or 5-6 people an hour as a formula for success. In an executive search context, that could include calls, voicemails, and live conversations with candidates or hiring managers. The exact metric is less important than the mindset: sales is a numbers game. Set a high but achievable target for daily outreach (calls/emails/LinkedIn messages) and hit it consistently. The more prospects you contact, the more chances to find that one who needs your service today.

Maintain a Cadence (Rhythm): Treat your day with structure. For example, dedicate certain hours to outbound calls (when you know executives are at their desks), other slots for research or admin. The manual implies keeping a steady pace – “5-6 an hour” means you’re not letting an hour go by without some quality conversations. Top brokers kept the phone in their hand and kept dialing; top recruiters similarly should avoid long lulls. Avoid time-wasting between calls – don’t fall into the trap of chatting with coworkers or browsing the internet excessively during prime calling time. As the manual bluntly puts it: “Don’t waste time, there are only so many hours in a day… You’ve got to get the dials in.”.

No Excuses, No Stories: A striking Stratton rule: “Never comment on or after each phone call or lead… Who cares how your conversation with Mr. Jones was? Good or bad, who cares? Just get your leads and do your job.”. This means don’t spend time celebrating a good call or commiserating a bad one – move on to the next call. In a recruiting office, it’s easy to vent after a rude prospect or boast after a great meeting. But excessive post-mortems waste time and can sap momentum. Save detailed debriefs for later. Keep pushing through your call list while you’re “in the zone.”

Track Your Activity and Results: The manual shows that Stratton kept track of dials and outcomes (even providing sheets to log calls). Developing a habit of tracking metrics is invaluable. Log how many calls you made, how many contacts, how many leads advanced. This will help you understand your ratios (e.g., it might take 20 calls to get 5 conversations to get 1 client meeting). Tracking also keeps you honest – if you only made 10 calls today and your goal was 30, it’s right there in black and white. Modern recruiters can use CRM software to log calls and notes. The key is consistency: what gets measured gets improved. Additionally, keep records of each prospect: Stratton trainees saved lead cards and marked them with codes like H = hostile, D = disconnected, O/B = has another broker. You should similarly note important details (e.g., “Not hiring till Q4,” “Prefers email contact,” “Has HR gatekeeper named Susan,” etc.). These notes save time in the future and let you follow up intelligently.

Be Proactive and Don’t Procrastinate: In sales, especially when working independently, self-discipline is crucial. The manual extols doing the hardest, most important tasks first each day. For a recruiter, this might mean making that call you’re nervous about first thing in the morning before you lose your nerve, or tackling outreach to new clients before getting absorbed in routine tasks. If you have a target list of companies, start calling them early. “This business is not a sprint but a marathon,” the manual reminds, and the winners keep a steady, relentless pace. They don’t take long, unplanned breaks or “drift into space” at their desks. Treat the job like a high-performance sport: you must be mentally present and hustling from start to finish each day.

Build Good Habits, Break Bad Habits: “You first make your habits, then your habits make you” is a line from the Stratton material. Successful brokers cultivated habits that supported success, from how they organized their lead lists to how they started their mornings. Likewise, identify your habits – which ones help (e.g., daily planning, timely follow-ups) and which hurt (e.g., checking social media too often, avoiding cold calls until late in the day). Consciously replace bad habits with good ones. For instance, if you tend to postpone difficult calls, create a habit loop where 9:00-10:00 AM is always power-calling time, no exceptions. Over time, these routines become automatic and push you forward even on days you feel less motivated.

Stay Motivated and Goal-Focused: To sustain such discipline, keep your goals visible. The manual advised brokers to keep reminders in sight – e.g., *“next to the phone – a picture of the new car you want”*. You might keep a visual of your personal “why” at your desk (a dream vacation, your family, a luxury you want to afford, etc.). Also, review your targets daily (as mentioned in the goal-setting section). The manual’s “thank every prospect… for their time” rule even has a self-motivational angle – by treating each contact as a step toward your goal (and being grateful for the chance), you maintain a positive mindset through the grind.

Work Hard, Win Easy (Later): One memorable piece of advice: *“Be prepared to live for your first two years like no one else… working harder than you ever thought possible, and for the rest of your life you will live like no one can.”*. In recruiting, especially if you are early in your career or building a desk from scratch, the message is to front-load your hard work. Make those extra calls, put in the extra hours now, and you will reap rewards later in forms like a strong referral network, repeat clients, and a reputation that brings business to you. The grind won’t last forever if you do it right – it sets up a momentum that makes later work easier.

Professionalism and Integrity: Discipline is not only about activity, but also about how you conduct yourself. Always behave professionally. The manual insists on being polite and respectful to everyone, including secretaries and assistants, because every interaction reflects on you and your firm. In practice, that means no matter how tired or frustrated you are, maintain courtesy on calls and emails. If you promised to do something (even as simple as sending an email by end of day), do it. These little things compound into a reputation for reliability and integrity – which in the long run, is a huge asset in the recruiting business where relationships are everything.


In summary, the top performers adhere to a daily system: High volume of quality outreach, rigorous time management, relentless follow-through, and constant self-improvement. They treat each workday as an opportunity to execute their success habits. By emulating the Stratton Oakmont level of discipline – minus any negative boiler-room excesses – a recruiter can dramatically increase their productivity and results.

Key Terminology for Success (Adapted to Recruiting)

(Below are key sales terms and concepts from the Stratton Oakmont manual, translated into the executive recruiting context for clarity.)

Prospect: A potential customer or candidate who has not yet done business with you. In Stratton terms, a prospect was a potential investor; for a recruiter, a prospect could be a hiring manager at a target company or a candidate in your industry that you haven’t placed yet. The manual often uses “prospect” generally (e.g., *“prospect you’re calling is hostile”*). Keeping a healthy list of prospects is vital for pipeline building.

Lead: Similar to prospect, though sometimes implying a prospect with contact information and some initial qualification. Stratton trainees worked through leads (names on call lists) to find qualified prospects. In recruiting, a lead might be a name or referral you obtained that needs further qualification. A “qualified lead” is one that meets your criteria to pursue actively.

Qualifying (Qualification): The process of determining whether a prospect has the characteristics that make them worth pursuing. This is a critical step stressed in the manual – *“the road to riches starts with the correct qualification”*. In recruiting, qualifying means verifying a client’s hiring potential (need, budget, authority, timeline) or a candidate’s suitability and interest (skills, experience, openness, fit). Strong qualification upfront leads to higher close rates.

Cold Call: An unsolicited call to someone who isn’t expecting to hear from you. Stratton Oakmont built its empire on aggressive cold calling, with brokers dialing hundreds of strangers daily. In executive recruiting, cold calling might mean reaching out to an executive who hasn’t interacted with you before (often to pitch them a job opportunity or to pitch your recruiting services to their company). It requires quick rapport-building and a strong opener because, as the manual humorously notes, on a busy executive’s list of people they want to talk to, a cold-calling salesperson might rank near “the IRS” if not done tactfully. Effective cold calling follows the script and objection-handling techniques discussed above.

Objection: Any statement from a prospect that signals resistance or unwillingness. Common examples: “I’m not interested,” “We have no need,” “Call me later,” etc. The Stratton manual catalogs many of these and provides rebuttals. In recruiting, objections might include “We’re not hiring,” “We use internal recruiters,” “I’m not looking to change jobs,” and so on. Expect objections as a normal part of the process – they are not rejections, but rather hurdles that can often be overcome with the right response.

Rebuttal: A scripted or planned response to an objection, aimed at removing the concern and keeping the conversation going. Rebuttals are a core part of Stratton sales training – each objection had a tailored answer. In our context, your rebuttals address the specific worries of clients or candidates. For instance, to “I’m not looking,” a candidate-focused rebuttal might highlight the unique opportunity and that there’s no commitment just to hear about it. Preparation of rebuttals is key to being smooth and confident under pressure.

Close (Closing): The act of securing a commitment or agreement from the prospect. This could be the ultimate close (signing a contract, making a placement) or a mini-close (agreeing to a meeting, committing to review a candidate resume). The manual encourages always closing on something – even if it’s small – in every interaction. In recruiting, closing often refers to getting the candidate to accept the job offer at the end of the process. But remember, closing is a series of steps: you close on the next call, then close on an interview, then close on an offer, etc. Strong closers are persistent, assume the sale in a positive way, and ask for what they want clearly.

Gatekeeper: While not explicitly defined in the Stratton text, this term is well-known in sales. It refers to assistants or receptionists who screen calls for the decision-maker. The Stratton manual implicitly acknowledges gatekeepers by advising never to be rude or dismissive to a prospect’s secretary. In recruiting, a gatekeeper could be an executive assistant or a switchboard operator who handles calls. Treat gatekeepers with respect and friendliness; often, winning them over can be the key to reaching the actual prospect.

Pipeline: Again, not a term used verbatim in the manual, but the concept is ever-present. A pipeline is the full range of prospects/leads at different stages of your process (contacted, meeting scheduled, in negotiation, etc.). Stratton’s emphasis on constantly calling and adding leads, as well as tracking follow-ups, is essentially pipeline management. In recruiting, maintaining a solid pipeline of clients and candidates ensures you always have potential deals in play. If one falls through, others are moving forward. A disciplined daily routine of prospecting and follow-up is how you keep the pipeline flowing.

Numbers Game: Salespeople often say “it’s a numbers game,” which aligns with Stratton’s guidance to make a high volume of calls. This means that, statistically, the more attempts you make, the more successes you will get, even if your success percentage stays constant. By playing the numbers game intelligently – contacting 50+ people a day as Stratton suggests – you essentially guarantee results through volume. For a recruiter, this could translate to sourcing a larger pool of candidates or reaching out to many potential clients, knowing that even if only a fraction respond, it will be enough to hit targets. The manual’s directive to “play by the numbers, it is proven, stick to it” encapsulates this concept.

Qualification “Board” Terms: (For completeness, the Stratton manual included some finance-specific definitions like “Penny Stock,” “NASDAQ,” etc., but those aren’t relevant to recruiting. Instead, focus on general sales terms above. If using the manual’s content as a guide, replace those finance terms with recruiting-specific ones when training yourself or your team.)


By understanding and utilizing these key terms and concepts, you can better interpret classic sales strategies and apply them effectively in the world of executive recruiting. The terminology may differ slightly, but the underlying principles from the Stratton Oakmont manual are highly applicable to winning in recruitment-focused sales.
