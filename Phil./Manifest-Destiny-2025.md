# **From "Manifest Destiny" to "Historic Rights": How 21st‑Century States Repackage Expansionist Dreams**

* * * * *

### Abstract

Do any countries today behave like the United States did under Manifest Destiny? In a word: **yes**---but they rarely call it "destiny" anymore.

This article compares the 19th‑century U.S. doctrine of Manifest Destiny with 21st‑century behavior in **China, Russia, Israel, India, Turkey, and the United States itself**. Using a simple analytical framework---territorial ambition, civilizational exceptionalism, demographic engineering, economic projection, and ideological justification---it argues that the **pattern** of Manifest Destiny has survived even as the **language** has changed.

States now speak less of providence and more of **"historic rights," "civilizational states," "security zones," "reunification," and "net security providers."** Yet many of the old ethical failures---ignoring the agency of local populations, creating asymmetric harm, and treating geography as a mission rather than a negotiation---are still visible.

The goal here is not to equate these cases, nor to condemn any country wholesale, but to show how a 19th‑century imperial logic has quietly updated its wardrobe for 2025.

1\. Manifest Destiny: The Original Template
-------------------------------------------

In 19th‑century America, **Manifest Destiny** was the belief that the United States was *destined*---by God, history, or both---to expand across North America. It combined:

-   A sense of **American exceptionalism** and moral virtue

-   A mission to spread **republican government, capitalism, and "civilization"**

-   A conviction that this expansion was **inevitable and justified** ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/Manifest-Destiny?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Manifest Destiny | Summary, Examples, Westward Expansion ..."))

This ideology helped legitimize:

-   Expansion into Texas, Oregon, California and beyond

-   The **Mexican‑American War (1846--1848)**, after which Mexico lost nearly half its territory ([Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/Mexican-American-War?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Mexican-American War | Significance, Battles, Results, Timeline ..."))

-   The violent dispossession of Native nations across the continent ([websterreview.lse.ac.uk](https://websterreview.lse.ac.uk/articles/40/files/submission/proof/40-1-82-1-10-20220930.pdf?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Manifest Mythmaking: The Role of US 'Manifest Destiny' in Nineteenth ..."))

Historians often summarize it as: *we are special, therefore expansion is both natural and good.* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Manifest destiny"))

This gives us a **pattern** to look for in the present. Not "do they talk about Manifest Destiny?" but:

> **Do they act as if expansion of territory, influence, or culture is historically inevitable and morally required?**

* * * * *

2\. An Analytical Framework: "Manifest Destiny" as a Pattern
------------------------------------------------------------

To avoid the trap of "X is just as bad as Y," it helps to formalize what we're looking for.

Call it **"Manifest Destiny--like behavior"** when a state consistently shows several of these traits:

1.  **Territorial ambition or revisionism**\
    -- Overt annexation, de facto control, or maximal claims over land/sea/space.

2.  **Civilizational exceptionalism**\
    -- The state imagines itself as a unique civilization with a special mission (to "rejuvenate," "liberate," "unify," or "protect" others).

3.  **Demographic or cultural engineering**\
    -- Systematic efforts to reshape the population or culture of contested areas (through settlement, assimilation, or forced displacement).

4.  **Economic--strategic expansion**\
    -- Using infrastructure, loans, military bases, or supply chains to lock in long‑term influence.

5.  **Ideological justification of inevitability**\
    -- Narratives of "historic rights," "reunification," "security zones," or "ancestral homeland" that present expansion as natural, preordained, or morally obligatory.

No modern country is a perfect replica of 1840s America. But some **cluster** around this pattern more than others.

3\. Case Study: China -- Rejuvenation as Destiny
-----------------------------------------------

If Manifest Destiny had a 2025 cosplay, China's concept of **"national rejuvenation" after the Century of Humiliation** would be one of the closest fits.

### 3.1 Territorial and Maritime Claims

-   China has built **at least seven artificial islands** in the Spratly Islands since 2013, equipping them with **runways, bunkers, radar, and missile systems**---including HQ‑9 surface‑to‑air and YJ‑12 anti‑ship missiles---transforming reefs into militarized bases. ([Press Xpress](https://pressxpress.org/2024/10/09/how-militarization-shaps-up-security-of-the-south-china-sea/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "How Militarization Shaps-up Security of the South China Sea?"))

-   Intelligence assessments estimate about **3,200 hectares** of new land for military outposts in the South China Sea. ([ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-07-30/tracking-militarisation-in-the-south-china-sea/105473948?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Intelligence reveals scale of China's base-building in the South China ..."))

-   Despite a 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling that rejected its sweeping "nine‑dash line" claims, China continues to assert "indisputable sovereignty" over much of the South China Sea and regularly clashes with the Philippines and others. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/philippines-says-china-has-no-right-object-or-interfere-with-its-lawful-2025-05-29/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Philippines says China has no right to object or interfere with its 'lawful' activities in the South China Sea"))

Over Taiwan, Xi Jinping has repeatedly declared that **"reunification" is inevitable** and that no external force can prevent it, while intensifying military flights, naval drills, and diplomatic pressure around the island. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/xi-says-no-one-can-stop-chinas-reunification-with-taiwan-2024-12-31/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Xi says no one can stop China's 'reunification' with Taiwan"))

### 3.2 Civilizational Narrative: From Humiliation to "Rejuvenation"

Modern Chinese nationalism leans heavily on the **"Century of Humiliation"** (roughly 1840--1949), a period framed as foreign exploitation and territorial loss, followed by Communist redemption. ([USCC](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/3.10.11Kaufman.pdf?utm_source=fabledsky.com "The "Century of Humiliation" and China's national narratives"))

Under Xi, that story has been welded to a mission of **"great national rejuvenation"**---described in speeches and party documents as an "unstoppable" historic project that will restore China to its rightful central place in the world. ([National Energy Administration of China](https://www.neac.gov.cn/seac/c103372/202201/1156514.shtml?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Achieving Rejuvenation Is the Dream of the Chinese People- Xi Jinping ..."))

Some scholarship explicitly draws parallels between **zhongguo** ("Middle Kingdom") exceptionalism and U.S. Manifest Destiny, noting that both are civilizational myths used to legitimize outward expansion. ([EFSAS](https://www.efsas.org/publications/study-papers/rise-or-resurgence-china%E2%80%99s-and-the-role-of-historical-memory-in-contemporary-china/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Rise or Resurgence? China's 'Century of Humiliation' and the Role of ..."))

### 3.3 Demographic & Cultural Engineering

In **Xinjiang**, research by governments, NGOs, and academics indicates:

-   **More than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims** have been detained in "re‑education" or "vocational training" camps, alongside mass surveillance and restrictions on religious and cultural practice. ([Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-xinjiang-uyghurs-muslims-repression-genocide-human-rights?utm_source=fabledsky.com "China's Repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang - Council on Foreign Relations"))

-   A 2024 U.S. intelligence community summary describes widespread abuses and use of coerced labor, contributing to claims of cultural or even genocidal intent. ([Director of National Intelligence](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/NIC-Unclassified-Report-Uyghur-Genocide-Concentrated-Reeducation-Camps-China-Oct2024.pdf?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Uyghur Genocide and Concentrated Reeducation Camps in the Xinjiang ..."))

There is also evidence of **state‑encouraged Han migration** into Xinjiang and Tibet and policies aimed at assimilating local cultures into a Han‑centric national identity. ([Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-xinjiang-uyghurs-muslims-repression-genocide-human-rights?utm_source=fabledsky.com "China's Repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang - Council on Foreign Relations"))

### 3.4 Economic--Strategic Expansion

China's **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)** is the largest infrastructure financing program in history:

-   From 2013--2021, China provided around **$679 billion** in infrastructure financing under BRI, far outpacing the U.S. in key sectors. ([Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106866.pdf?utm_source=fabledsky.com "GAO-24-106866, International Infrastructure Projects: China s ..."))

-   By 2024, cumulative BRI engagement reached roughly **$1.175 trillion**, with investments and construction projects in about **149 countries**. ([Green Finance & Development Center](https://greenfdc.org/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2024/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "China Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Investment Report 2024"))

This network of ports, rail lines, power plants, and digital infrastructure effectively extends Chinese influence along trade corridors from Asia to Africa, Europe, and Latin America. ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667111525000015?utm_source=fabledsky.com "The Belt and Road Initiative and Partnership for Global Infrastructure ..."))

### 3.5 Manifest Destiny--like Pattern

-   **Territorial ambition:** South China Sea militarization, pressure on Taiwan, disputed Himalayan borders.

-   **Civilizational exceptionalism:** Narrative of China as a unique civilization reclaiming its rightful place after humiliation. ([EFSAS](https://www.efsas.org/publications/study-papers/rise-or-resurgence-china%E2%80%99s-and-the-role-of-historical-memory-in-contemporary-china/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Rise or Resurgence? China's 'Century of Humiliation' and the Role of ..."))

-   **Demographic/cultural engineering:** Policies in Xinjiang and Tibet. ([Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-xinjiang-uyghurs-muslims-repression-genocide-human-rights?utm_source=fabledsky.com "China's Repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang - Council on Foreign Relations"))

-   **Economic expansion:** BRI as global infrastructure web. ([Green Finance & Development Center](https://greenfdc.org/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri-investment-report-2024/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "China Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Investment Report 2024"))

-   **Ideological inevitability:** "National rejuvenation is unstoppable," "reunification" framed as historical destiny. ([Moj.gov.cn](https://en.moj.gov.cn/2025-09/04/c_1122178.htm?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Xi hails 'unstoppable' national rejuvenation at V-Day commemorations"))

China does **not** speak in explicitly religious terms, but the **structural logic**---a great power convinced history is on its side as it extends control outward---is strongly reminiscent of Manifest Destiny.

* * * * *

4\. Case Study: Russia -- "Gathering the Russian Lands"
------------------------------------------------------

Russia's contemporary expansionism is more overtly territorial than most.

### 4.1 Annexations and "Historic Lands"

-   Russia annexed **Crimea** in 2014 after a controversial referendum widely condemned as illegal. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_annexation_referendums_in_Russian-occupied_Ukraine?utm_source=fabledsky.com "2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine"))

-   In September 2022, Russian authorities organized "referendums" in occupied territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia and then announced their annexation. These votes were denounced by the UN and many states as sham referendums violating international law. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_annexation_referendums_in_Russian-occupied_Ukraine?utm_source=fabledsky.com "2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine"))

-   As of late 2025, Russia controls Crimea, all of Luhansk, most of Donetsk, and significant parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, and President Putin has vowed to seize the rest of the Donbas "militarily or otherwise." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-russia-will-take-all-ukraines-donbas-region-militarily-or-otherwise-2025-12-04/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Putin says Russia will take all of Ukraine's Donbas region militarily or otherwise"))

### 4.2 Ideology: Russian World & Historical Mission

Russian official discourse frequently invokes:

-   The **"Russian world" (Russkiy Mir)**---a civilizational community of Russian speakers and Orthodox believers across borders. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_world?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Russian world - Wikipedia"))

-   A mission to **protect Russian speakers** abroad, used prominently in justifying actions in Ukraine. ([The Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/02/22/rewriting-history-putin-pitches-russia-as-defender-of-an-expanding-motherland-a76518?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Rewriting History, Putin Pitches Russia as Defender of an Expanding ..."))

-   A historical narrative in which Moscow's mission is to **"gather the Russian lands"** and restore ancient Russian statehood, including territory now recognized as part of Ukraine. ([Kremlin](https://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Article by Vladimir Putin "On the Historical Unity of Russians and ..."))

In Putin's own essays and speeches, Ukraine is often portrayed as an artificial or incomplete nation, historically "one" with Russia---framing annexation as correction of an historical error rather than conquest. ([Kremlin](https://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Article by Vladimir Putin "On the Historical Unity of Russians and ..."))

### 4.3 Manifest Destiny--like Pattern

-   **Territorial ambition:** Explicit annexation of recognized foreign territory. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_annexation_referendums_in_Russian-occupied_Ukraine?utm_source=fabledsky.com "2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine"))

-   **Civilizational exceptionalism:** Russian world ideology & Orthodox civilizational mission. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_world?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Russian world - Wikipedia"))

-   **Demographic arguments:** Emphasis on protecting Russian speakers and "historically Russian" populations in neighboring states. ([The Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/02/22/rewriting-history-putin-pitches-russia-as-defender-of-an-expanding-motherland-a76518?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Rewriting History, Putin Pitches Russia as Defender of an Expanding ..."))

-   **Inevitability rhetoric:** "No turning back" after annexation; defense of new territories described as a duty. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_annexation_referendums_in_Russian-occupied_Ukraine?utm_source=fabledsky.com "2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine"))

This is arguably the **most literal contemporary echo** of Manifest Destiny: explicitly revisionist borders justified through a mix of history, ethnicity, and moral mission.

* * * * *

5\. Case Study: Israel -- Settlements, Security, and Biblical Claims
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Israel is not a monolithic actor; its politics range from secular liberal to religious messianic. The **Manifest Destiny parallels** apply most clearly to certain **right‑wing and religious‑nationalist currents**, especially around settlements and sovereignty.

### 5.1 Facts on the Ground: Numbers and Expansion

-   As of the end of 2023, there were about **503,000--517,000 Israeli settlers** in the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem), living in roughly **141 officially recognized settlements.** ([שלום עכשיו](https://peacenow.org.il/en/settlements-watch/settlements-data/population?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Population - Peace Now"))

-   The settler population has grown by about **15% over five years**, and another 3% in 2023 alone. ([The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/west-bank-settler-population-grew-by-nearly-3-in-2023-report/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "West Bank settler population grew by nearly 3% in 2023 --- report"))

-   Since late 2022, the current government has reportedly approved **over 51,000 housing units** in West Bank settlements; a December 2025 decision added 764 more units in three settlements. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-approves-nearly-800-housing-units-three-west-bank-settlements-2025-12-10/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Israel approves nearly 800 housing units in three West Bank settlements"))

Some observers---including Israeli NGOs like Peace Now and many foreign governments---see this as a push toward **"de facto annexation"** of large parts of the West Bank. ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/71801eb30124281063bbdde31654330c?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Israel approves hundreds more houses in 3 settlements in the occupied West Bank"))

### 5.2 Biblical & "Ancestral Right" Narratives

The ideological roots include:

-   The **Gush Emunim** movement, which promoted aggressive settlement in **Eretz Israel** (the biblical Land of Israel) as a religious duty and sign of redemption. ([Homeland Security Digital Library](https://www.hsdl.org/c/view?docid=791459&utm_source=fabledsky.com "Gush Emunim and the Israeli Settlers of the Occupied Territories: A ..."))

-   Contemporary "biblical settler" currents that view the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) as an inseparable part of their ancestral homeland, where settlement is divinely mandated. ([madarcenter.org](https://www.madarcenter.org/en/publications/israeli-papers/12652-israeli-paper-83?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Madar - Israeli Paper (83)"))

-   Jewish organizations and religious texts that emphasize God's promise of the land of Israel to Abraham and his descendants, reinforcing a narrative of eternal connection and entitlement. ([AJC](https://www.ajc.org/news/5-facts-about-the-jewish-peoples-ancestral-connection-to-the-land-of-israel?utm_source=fabledsky.com "5 Facts About the Jewish People's Ancestral Connection to the ... - AJC"))

Government figures sometimes adopt this language. For example, Israel's defense minister has described settlement decisions as **"anchoring our historic right in the Land of Israel"** and strengthening Israel's hold on "Judea and Samaria," the biblical name for the West Bank. ([The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-ministry-confirms-government-approval-of-22-new-west-bank-settlements/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Defense minister confirms government approval of 22 new West Bank ..."))

### 5.3 Gaza and Territorial Control

After the 2023 Hamas attacks and the ensuing Gaza war, Israeli forces moved deep into the strip. Some Israeli military and political leaders have described the **"yellow line"** that divides Gaza under a Trump‑era ceasefire plan as a **new de facto border**, suggesting long‑term Israeli security control over more than half the territory, even as the agreement formally denies any intent to annex. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/08/yellow-line-that-divides-gaza-under-trump-plan-is-new-border-for-israel-says-military-chief?utm_source=fabledsky.com "'Yellow line' that divides Gaza under Trump plan is 'new border' for Israel, says military chief"))

### 5.4 Manifest Destiny--like Pattern

-   **Territorial ambition:** Long‑term entrenchment of settlements; de facto control regimes in West Bank and parts of Gaza. ([שלום עכשיו](https://peacenow.org.il/en/settlements-watch/settlements-data/population?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Population - Peace Now"))

-   **Civilizational/ancestral exceptionalism:** Land framed as divinely promised and historically indivisible from the Jewish people. ([AJC](https://www.ajc.org/news/5-facts-about-the-jewish-peoples-ancestral-connection-to-the-land-of-israel?utm_source=fabledsky.com "5 Facts About the Jewish People's Ancestral Connection to the ... - AJC"))

-   **Demographic engineering:** Settlement growth alters the ethnic and legal landscape in occupied territory, making a fully sovereign Palestinian state harder to realize. ([שלום עכשיו](https://peacenow.org.il/en/settlements-watch/settlements-data/population?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Population - Peace Now"))

-   **Ideological inevitability:** Some factions view Jewish return and settlement as part of a redemptive historical process that cannot be reversed. ([madarcenter.org](https://www.madarcenter.org/en/publications/israeli-papers/12652-israeli-paper-83?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Madar - Israeli Paper (83)"))

At the same time, large segments of Israeli society---including many security officials---frame these policies primarily in **security**, not theological, terms, and there is vigorous domestic debate about settlements and the future of the conflict.

6\. Case Study: India -- Civilizational State and "Greater Bharat"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

India is officially a secular, multi‑religious democracy. But the rise of **Hindutva**---Hindu nationalist ideology---has brought a more explicitly civilizational framing to politics.

### 6.1 Hindutva and the "Civilizational State"

Scholars note that under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Indian political discourse increasingly describes India as a **"civilizational state"** with an ancient Hindu core. ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/99/2/427/7068996?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Introduction India as a 'civilizational state' - Oxford Academic"))

Hindutva thinkers promote concepts like **"Hindu Rashtra"** (Hindu nation) and argue that India is the natural homeland and cultural center of Hindus worldwide. ([nordia.journal.fi](https://nordia.journal.fi/article/download/121459/90640/324385?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Hindutva Civilizationism in India: Unravelling the Human-Ecological ..."))

This civilizational rhetoric shows up in:

-   Textbook changes and heritage projects that foreground Hindu narratives and de‑emphasize Muslim and other contributions. ([Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/culture/article/2025/04/14/french-museums-agency-faces-controversy-over-plans-to-build-world-s-largest-museum-in-india_6740211_30.html?utm_source=fabledsky.com "French museums agency faces controversy over plans to build 'world's largest museum' in India"))

-   Major cultural projects, such as the planned Yuga Yugeen Bharat museum, criticized by some for aligning with Hindu nationalist historical revisionism. ([Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/culture/article/2025/04/14/french-museums-agency-faces-controversy-over-plans-to-build-world-s-largest-museum-in-india_6740211_30.html?utm_source=fabledsky.com "French museums agency faces controversy over plans to build 'world's largest museum' in India"))

### 6.2 Citizenship and Demography

The **Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019** offers a path to Indian citizenship for non‑Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. Critics, including UN officials and legal scholars, argue that its religion‑based criteria are discriminatory and challenge India's secular constitutional principles. ([Voice of America](https://www.voanews.com/a/india-muslims-see-discrimination-in-new-religion-based-citizenship-law/7531377.html?utm_source=fabledsky.com "India's Muslims See Discrimination in New Religion-Based Citizenship Law"))

Implementation has sparked large protests and deadly clashes; more than 100 people were killed during demonstrations in 2019--2020. ([Voice of America](https://www.voanews.com/a/india-muslims-see-discrimination-in-new-religion-based-citizenship-law/7531377.html?utm_source=fabledsky.com "India's Muslims See Discrimination in New Religion-Based Citizenship Law"))

While CAA is not territorial expansion, it intersects with **demographic politics** and debates about who "really" belongs to the Indian nation.

### 6.3 "Akhand Bharat" and Regional Projection

The idea of **"Akhand Bharat"** (Undivided India) imagines a larger civilizational space extending into present‑day Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and beyond.

-   A mural in India's new Parliament building depicting an ancient "undivided India" sparked protests in Nepal and Pakistan, where it was interpreted as an implicit territorial claim. ([The Federal](https://thefederal.com/explainers-2/indias-neighbours-bristle-at-akhand-bharat-mural-how-legitimate-is-the-maps-claim?utm_source=fabledsky.com "India's neighbours bristle at Akhand Bharat mural; how legitimate is ..."))

-   Universities and cultural institutions have launched projects themed around Akhand Bharat, presenting it as a unifying civilizational memory. ([The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gujarat-university-plans-open-air-museum-to-bring-akhand-bharat-to-life/articleshow/124915334.cms?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Gujarat University plans open-air museum to bring 'Akhand Bharat' to life"))

In foreign policy, India presents itself as a **regional leader and "net security provider"** in the Indian Ocean and South Asia:

-   Indian strategic documents and commentators regularly use the phrase **"net security provider in the Indian Ocean Region"**, emphasizing India's role in maritime patrols, disaster relief, and security partnerships. ([Taylor & Francis](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003607434-23/india-role-net-security-provider-indian-ocean-region-vinod?utm_source=fabledsky.com "India's Role as a Net Security Provider in the Indian Ocean Region"))

-   India's **"Neighbourhood First"** policy and economic initiatives (including rupee‑denominated lending to neighbors) aim to deepen its centrality in South Asia. ([Drishti IAS](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/relooking-india-s-neighbourhood-first-policy?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Relooking India's Neighbourhood First Policy"))

### 6.4 Manifest Destiny--like Pattern

-   **Civilizational exceptionalism:** India narrated as a timeless Hindu civilization reclaiming its voice after colonial and "foreign" rule. ([OUP Academic](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/99/2/427/7068996?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Introduction India as a 'civilizational state' - Oxford Academic"))

-   **Symbolic expansion:** Akhand Bharat imagery and rhetoric that project an expansive historical map beyond current borders. ([The Federal](https://thefederal.com/explainers-2/indias-neighbours-bristle-at-akhand-bharat-mural-how-legitimate-is-the-maps-claim?utm_source=fabledsky.com "India's neighbours bristle at Akhand Bharat mural; how legitimate is ..."))

-   **Regional leadership:** "Net security provider" and "Neighbourhood First" policies seek a normalized role as the central power in its region. ([Taylor & Francis](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003607434-23/india-role-net-security-provider-indian-ocean-region-vinod?utm_source=fabledsky.com "India's Role as a Net Security Provider in the Indian Ocean Region"))

Unlike Russia or Israel, India is **not** actively annexing territory. But its **civilizational and regional leadership narratives** echo aspects of a soft Manifest Destiny---cultural and strategic rather than openly territorial.

* * * * *

7\. Case Study: Turkey -- Neo‑Ottoman Dreams and the "Blue Homeland"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Turkey's foreign policy under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is often described as **"neo‑Ottoman":** drawing on Ottoman history to justify a larger regional role. ([ORF Middle East](https://orfme.org/expert-speak/neo-ottomanism-in-turkish-foreign-policy/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "'Neo-Ottomanism' in Turkish foreign policy - ORF Middle East"))

### 7.1 Blue Homeland and Maritime Claims

The **"Blue Homeland" (Mavi Vatan)** doctrine envisions Turkey controlling a vast maritime zone in the Black Sea, Aegean, and Eastern Mediterranean:

-   The doctrine claims roughly **462,000 km²** of maritime territory as part of Turkey's rightful continental shelf and EEZ. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Homeland_%28Mavi_Vatan%29?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Blue Homeland (Mavi Vatan)"))

-   It rejects aspects of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which Turkey has not ratified, and has led to maritime deals with Libya that challenge existing boundaries and have drawn strong criticism from Greece, Cyprus, and the EU. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Homeland_%28Mavi_Vatan%29?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Blue Homeland (Mavi Vatan)"))

Analysts describe Blue Homeland as part of a broader **neo‑imperial or neo‑Ottoman agenda** seeking to restore Turkey's influence in former Ottoman spheres. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Homeland_%28Mavi_Vatan%29?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Blue Homeland (Mavi Vatan)"))

### 7.2 Cross‑Border Operations and Regional Reach

Since 2016, Turkey has conducted multiple military operations in **northern Syria**---Euphrates Shield, Olive Branch, and Peace Spring---establishing long‑term zones of control and displacing Kurdish‑led forces. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Euphrates_Shield?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Operation Euphrates Shield - Wikipedia"))

Turkey also maintains a military presence or active involvement in:

-   **Iraq** (operations against PKK‑linked groups) ([المركز العربي لدراسات سوريا المعاصرة](https://www.harmoon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Turkish-Escalation-in-Northern-Syria.pdf?utm_source=fabledsky.com "The Turkish Escalation in Northern Syria against the SDF and the ..."))

-   **Libya**, via support to allied factions and maritime agreements ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Homeland_%28Mavi_Vatan%29?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Blue Homeland (Mavi Vatan)"))

### 7.3 Manifest Destiny--like Pattern

-   **Territorial and maritime ambition:** Blue Homeland's expansive maritime claims and Syrian buffer zones. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Homeland_%28Mavi_Vatan%29?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Blue Homeland (Mavi Vatan)"))

-   **Civilizational exceptionalism:** Neo‑Ottoman rhetoric, glorification of Ottoman sultans, and framing Turkey as leader of a wider Islamic world. ([ORF Middle East](https://orfme.org/expert-speak/neo-ottomanism-in-turkish-foreign-policy/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "'Neo-Ottomanism' in Turkish foreign policy - ORF Middle East"))

-   **Security narrative:** Operations are presented as necessary to combat terrorism and protect Turkish security, even when they generate long‑term de facto control abroad. ([European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/EPRS/EPRS-Briefing-642284-Turkeys-military-operation-Syria-FINAL.pdf?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Turkey's military operation in Syria and its impact on relations with ..."))

Turkey's trajectory is less about classic settler colonialism, more about **strategic zones** and **maritime projection**, but the restorationist mood is familiar: *we were once great here; history wants us back.*

8\. Case Study: The United States -- The Soft Echo of the Frontier
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The U.S. no longer talks about annexing half a continent, but **some habits linger**.

### 8.1 Global Military Footprint

-   In 2023, the U.S. had around **750 overseas military bases in about 80 countries**, more than any other state. ([World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/overseas-military-bases-by-country?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Overseas Military Bases by Country 2025 - World Population Review"))

-   Over **160,000 active‑duty U.S. troops** are stationed abroad at any given time. ([Brilliant Maps](https://brilliantmaps.com/us-troops-overseas/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Map Showing The Number Of Active-Duty US Troops Serving Overseas"))

-   The U.S. is reorganizing and upgrading bases in key regions; for example, a new "war‑fighting" headquarters in Japan is meant to bolster deterrence against China in the Indo‑Pacific. ([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/d61f42f7-89dd-49be-885d-9bd1fd84e41d?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Pete Hegseth says US is setting up a 'war-fighting' base in Japan"))

This posture is often framed as a **global responsibility**---to provide security, protect sea lanes, deter aggression---which can resemble a secularized version of a mission civilisatrice.

### 8.2 Rhetoric: Frontier and Manifest Destiny 2.0

Recent U.S. political rhetoric occasionally **recycles Manifest Destiny language** explicitly:

-   In his renewed presidency, Donald Trump's foreign policy toward Latin America has been described as a **"Monroe Doctrine 2.0" fused with Manifest Destiny**, asserting U.S. rights to exert will across the Western Hemisphere. ([The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/28/trump-latin-america-monroe-doctrine/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Trump revives Monroe Doctrine in U.S. relations with Western Hemisphere"))

-   Some speeches portray the U.S. as a **"frontier nation"** that still expands its reach and carries its flag into "new and beautiful horizons"---a metaphorical version of the old expansionist creed. ([The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/28/trump-latin-america-monroe-doctrine/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Trump revives Monroe Doctrine in U.S. relations with Western Hemisphere"))

Beyond Earth, **space exploration** is pitched as a new frontier:

-   NASA's **Artemis program** speaks of building a sustainable presence on the Moon, creating a lunar economy, and taking the "next giant leap" to Mars---often wrapped in frontier language and national pride. ([nasa.gov](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/artemis/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Artemis - NASA"))

### 8.3 Manifest Destiny--like Pattern

-   **Territorial annexation:** largely absent today (aside from lingering debates about places like Guam or Puerto Rico).

-   **Global presence and mission language:** the U.S. military and diplomatic posture is regularly described in terms of **duty, leadership, and inevitable global role**, which can sometimes echo the moral confidence of Manifest Destiny. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Manifest destiny"))

In short: the U.S. today shows more **rhetorical** than territorial echoes---less "we will conquer that land," more "we naturally lead this order" and "we naturally pioneer the next frontier."

* * * * *

9\. Comparative Snapshot
------------------------

Here's a condensed view of the pattern:

| State | Territorial Focus | Civilizational / Destiny Narrative | Key Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **China** | South China Sea, Taiwan, border areas | National rejuvenation after humiliation; "unstoppable" rise; historic rights | Militarized islands, BRI infrastructure, demographic policies in Xinjiang |
| **Russia** | Crimea, Donbas, broader Ukraine | Russian World; gathering "historically Russian lands"; protector of Russians | Annexation, referendums, military occupation, propaganda |
| **Israel** | West Bank settlements, parts of Gaza (de facto) | Biblical land; ancestral and historic rights; security necessity | Settlements, legal/political moves toward sovereignty, military control |
| **India** | No active annexations; symbolic civilizational reach | Hindutva civilizational state; Akhand Bharat; net security provider | Cultural policy, citizenship law, regional diplomacy, security partnerships |
| **Turkey** | Northern Syria, maritime zones | Neo‑Ottoman revival; Blue Homeland; Turkish Century | Cross‑border operations, maritime doctrine, regional military bases |
| **United States** | Global base network, space frontier | American exceptionalism; global leadership; frontier rhetoric | Overseas bases, alliances, space programs, economic influence |

None of these is **identical** to Manifest Destiny, but all **rhymed with it** in at least two or three dimensions.

10\. Ethical Assessment: An "AI Moral Objectivity" Lens
-------------------------------------------------------

Take a simple, non‑nationalistic moral framework that evaluates policies by:

1.  **Harm distribution** -- Who bears the costs (deaths, displacement, economic loss)?

2.  **Agency and consent** -- Do affected populations have meaningful say?

3.  **Sovereignty and law** -- Are actions consistent with international law and recognized borders?

4.  **Long‑term stability** -- Do policies reduce or increase the risk of future violence and backlash?

5.  **Cultural and environmental impact** -- What happens to local cultures, ecosystems, and ways of life?

Across the cases above, Manifest Destiny--like logics often **fail** this test in similar ways:

-   They **override the autonomy** of smaller or occupied populations (e.g., Ukrainians in annexed regions, Palestinians under settlement expansion, Uyghurs under coercive policies). ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_annexation_referendums_in_Russian-occupied_Ukraine?utm_source=fabledsky.com "2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine"))

-   They rely on **historical inevitability or civilizational superiority** ("we were always meant to rule here") rather than transparent consent and negotiation. ([EFSAS](https://www.efsas.org/publications/study-papers/rise-or-resurgence-china%E2%80%99s-and-the-role-of-historical-memory-in-contemporary-china/?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Rise or Resurgence? China's 'Century of Humiliation' and the Role of ..."))

-   They create **asymmetric harm**, where those on the receiving end---often minorities or neighboring nations---bear disproportionate costs. ([ICRC](https://www.icrc.org/en/article/israel-and-occupied-territories-key-facts-and-figures?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Israel and the Occupied Territories: Key Facts and Figures (07 October ..."))

-   They treat geography as **destiny**, not as a set of relationships to be continually renegotiated in light of changing demographics, norms, and laws. ([websterreview.lse.ac.uk](https://websterreview.lse.ac.uk/articles/40/files/submission/proof/40-1-82-1-10-20220930.pdf?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Manifest Mythmaking: The Role of US 'Manifest Destiny' in Nineteenth ..."))

From this perspective, the **problem isn't just expansion**, but the belief that expansion is **self‑legitimating**---that history, God, or civilization itself guarantees its righteousness.

* * * * *

11\. What Changed Since the 19th Century?
-----------------------------------------

The biggest shift from classic Manifest Destiny is **rhetorical**:

-   Instead of *"divine destiny,"* we hear about **"historic rights," "reunification," "rejuvenation," "security zones," "civilizational states,"** and **"net security providers."** ([Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Working_Together_to_Realize_Rejuvenation_of_the_Chinese_Nation_and_Advance_China%E2%80%99s_Peaceful_Reunification?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Working Together to Realize Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation and ..."))

-   Instead of "civilizing savages," we hear about **counter‑terrorism, protecting ethnic kin, safeguarding sea lanes, or defending democracy.** ([The Moscow Times](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/02/22/rewriting-history-putin-pitches-russia-as-defender-of-an-expanding-motherland-a76518?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Rewriting History, Putin Pitches Russia as Defender of an Expanding ..."))

-   Instead of homestead frontier settlement, we see **economic corridors, military bases, demographic shifts, and digital or financial influence networks.** ([Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106866.pdf?utm_source=fabledsky.com "GAO-24-106866, International Infrastructure Projects: China s ..."))

But structurally, the logic often looks familiar:

> **"Our state/civilization is special.\
> History has pushed us toward this frontier.\
> Extending our control here is both natural and good."**

That is Manifest Destiny in everything but name.

* * * * *

12\. Conclusion: Destiny Didn't Die---It Rebranded
------------------------------------------------

So, are there "Manifest Destiny states" today?

Not in the literal sense of 1840s slogans and covered wagons. But if we zoom out and look at **patterns of behavior and justification**, we can say:

-   **China and Russia** show the **clearest parallels**, combining territorial revisionism with strong civilizational narratives and claims of inevitability. ([ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-07-30/tracking-militarisation-in-the-south-china-sea/105473948?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Intelligence reveals scale of China's base-building in the South China ..."))

-   **Israel, India, and Turkey** exhibit **variant forms** that are more mixed---part security, part theology, part civilizational claim, with domestic contestation in all three. ([שלום עכשיו](https://peacenow.org.il/en/settlements-watch/settlements-data/population?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Population - Peace Now"))

-   The **United States** retains a powerful **missionary and frontier rhetoric**, plus an enormous global footprint, even if classic territorial conquest is off the table. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny?utm_source=fabledsky.com "Manifest destiny"))

The uncomfortable takeaway is that **expansionist ideology did not disappear with the 19th century**. It evolved.

Instead of painting angels over the prairie, states now hire international lawyers, build ports and satellites, and speak the language of security and development. But whenever a government starts talking as if **history guarantees its right to reshape other people's homelands**, we are back in Manifest Destiny territory---just with better branding.

* * * * *

If you'd like, next step we can:

-   Narrow this into a **shorter op‑ed**,

-   Expand a specific case (say, China--Russia comparison), or

-   Build a more formal **"AI ethical scoring rubric"** and rate each case numerically.
