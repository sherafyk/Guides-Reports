Introduction
------------

Potty training a toddler with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and speech delays requires patience, consistency, and a tailored approach. Children with ASD often thrive on routine and visual learning, but they may have difficulty communicating their needs and adapting to change[*[1]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Many%20find%20it%20extremely%20difficult,unfamiliar%20surroundings%20of%20the%20bathroom). In this guide, we outline a **two-week, step-by-step potty training plan** designed for a 2.8-year-old boy on the autism spectrum. This plan is grounded in expert recommendations (e.g. American Academy of Pediatrics and autism specialists) and accounts for his unique needs -- including limited verbal communication, love of the "Miss Rachel" potty song, and tendency to hide when he needs to poop. The goal is to achieve significant progress toward independent toileting in 14 days by utilizing evidence-based strategies. Remember, every child is different, so adapt the plan as needed and stay positive and supportive throughout the process[*[2]*](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/1015/p468.html#:~:text=Throughout%20training%2C%20parents%20should%20remain,1).

Recognizing Readiness and Challenges
------------------------------------

Before diving in, it's important to confirm that your child shows signs of potty training readiness and understand how ASD might affect training:

- **Readiness Signs:** Your child is already showing key readiness cues. He stays dry for a couple of hours at a time and has fairly predictable bowel movements, which are good indicators of physical readiness[*[3]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Your%20first%20step%20is%20to,which%20may%20interfere%20with%20training). He also signals the urge to poop by hiding in a quiet spot -- a sign that he can sense the urge and prefers privacy[*[3]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Your%20first%20step%20is%20to,which%20may%20interfere%20with%20training). These behaviors suggest he is ready to begin training.

- **Communication Gaps:** Because he has limited verbal expression, he may not **ask** to use the potty or say when he needs to go. This is common in children with speech delays or ASD[*[4]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=to%20the%20concept%20of%20potty,to%20go%2C%20and%20so%20on). We will use simple words, signs, and visual cues to bridge this gap, rather than expecting him to tell us outright when he has to go. For example, many children with ASD benefit from a single-picture symbol (like a photo of a toilet) or a simple gesture to indicate potty needs[*[5]*](https://raisingchildren.net.au/autism/health-wellbeing/toileting-hygiene/toilet-training-autism#:~:text=say%2C%20%E2%80%98Eddie%2C%20sit%20on%20the,PECS).

- **Autism-Related Challenges:** Children on the spectrum may be extra sensitive to changes in routine or sensory aspects of the bathroom (sounds, smells, the feel of toilet seat, etc.)[*[1]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Many%20find%20it%20extremely%20difficult,unfamiliar%20surroundings%20of%20the%20bathroom). They might also have trouble imitating others or generalizing what they learn to new contexts[*[6]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=For%20some%20children%2C%20simply%20learning,stubbornness%2C%20and%20refusal%20to%20cooperate). This guide will address these challenges by introducing a **consistent routine**, using **visual supports**, and making the bathroom environment comfortable. Keep in mind that while most children with developmental delays *can* be toilet trained, it often takes longer -- sometimes months to a year of practice[*[7]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Most%20children%20with%20a%20developmental,of%20the%20need%20to%20go). **Our intensive two-week plan is meant to jump-start the process**, but full mastery (especially self-initiation and overnight dryness) may come with continued practice beyond these two weeks[*[7]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Most%20children%20with%20a%20developmental,of%20the%20need%20to%20go). Don't be discouraged -- with consistency and positive reinforcement, he will make progress at his own pace.

Preparation: Setting the Stage (Before Day 1)
---------------------------------------------

Successful potty training starts with good preparation. Take a day or two *before* the intensive training to organize materials and introduce key concepts:

- **Consult and Check**: If you haven't already, consider a quick check-in with his pediatrician. Rule out any medical issues (like constipation or urinary tract infection) that could interfere with training[*[3]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Your%20first%20step%20is%20to,which%20may%20interfere%20with%20training). Ensuring he's healthy will make training smoother.

- **Create a Potty-Friendly Environment**: You've already set up a dedicated toddler potty area, which is excellent. Make sure it's as comfortable and sensory-friendly as possible. For example, if the bathroom floor is cold, have him wear socks so he's not distressed by the chill[*[8]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Get%20your%20child%20familiar%20with,Page%203%2F5). If the overhead light is harsh, use a night-light or softer lighting. Ensure the potty seat is child-sized or has a reducer ring so he feels secure (you've provided a toddler seat with a little staircase -- perfect for stability and giving him independence). Place a small stool or that built-in step so his feet are supported when sitting; this helps him feel stable and is better for pushing during bowel movements[*[8]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Get%20your%20child%20familiar%20with,Page%203%2F5). Keep the potty in the **same location** consistently (his special powder room) so it becomes a familiar part of his routine[*[9]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Once%20you%20have%20placed%20a,can%20take%20care%20of%20themselves).

- **Assemble Supplies**: Stock up on training essentials. Have **multiple pairs of training underpants or cotton underwear** ready, because accidents will happen. Using cloth underwear (or reusable training pants with a waterproof liner) during waking hours is recommended so he can **feel** when he's wet -- this awareness helps reinforce the concept that pee belongs in the potty[*[10]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=number%20of%20changes%20children%20experience,This%20is)[*[11]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=,child%20understand%20what%20to%20do). You can put a disposable pull-up *over* the underwear for outings or naps to contain mess, but try to avoid relying on pull-ups alone during the day at home, since they feel like diapers. Also gather: flushable wipes, a stack of easy-change clothes, a waterproof mattress protector for nap/night, and cleaning supplies for accidents. Importantly, prepare **rewards** that will motivate him -- small treats or favorite activities (we'll cover this more below).

- **Use Consistent Language**: Decide on the **one term** you will use for pottying and stick to it[*[12]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=clearer%20than%20asking%20your%20child,This). If you've been calling it "potty," continue with that. Make sure *all* caregivers use the same word every time (not "bathroom" one time and "potty" another)[*[12]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=clearer%20than%20asking%20your%20child,This). Consistency will reduce confusion for him. Also plan a simple phrase for the action, like "go potty" or "pee in the potty." Given his language delay, keep instructions to **one step** and concrete: e.g., "sit on potty" and later "put pee in potty"[*[13]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Use%20specific%20language,be%20confusing%20for%20children%20with). Avoid long explanations. The same goes for any sign or gesture -- for instance, you might teach him a simple sign for "toilet" (many families use a T-handshape or a pointing-to-diaper gesture). Use this word or sign **every single time** you take him to the toilet, so he gradually connects that word/sign with the action[*[14]*](https://raisingchildren.net.au/autism/health-wellbeing/toileting-hygiene/toilet-training-autism#:~:text=they%E2%80%99re%20being%20punished.%20,using%20the%20Picture%20Exchange%20Communication).

- **Introduce a Visual Schedule**: Children with ASD are strong visual learners[*[15]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Visual%20supports%20Children%20with%20ASD,PECS%29%20or%20other%20visual). Create a **picture sequence** showing the steps of using the potty. You can make this by taking photos or using simple icons for each step (e.g., a picture of a toilet, of pants down, of sitting on the toilet, of toilet paper, of flushing, and handwashing). Arrange these images in order and tape the chart to the bathroom wall at his eye level[*[16]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=You%20could%20try%20creating%20a,way%2C%20training%20will%20be%20consistent). This visual schedule will serve as a constant reminder of the routine and help him understand what comes next. Go over the picture sequence with him a couple of times a day even before you start training, so it becomes familiar[*[16]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=You%20could%20try%20creating%20a,way%2C%20training%20will%20be%20consistent). During training, you'll refer to it often (point to each step as you guide him). This way, even if he doesn't understand all verbal instructions, the pictures provide clarity and predictability about the process[*[17]*](https://raisingchildren.net.au/autism/health-wellbeing/toileting-hygiene/toilet-training-autism#:~:text=Visual%20cues%20and%20prompts%20can,Image%3A%20Simple%20toilet%20training%20steps).

- **Gather Motivation: Special Rewards**: Determine what *really* motivates your son. Typical potty training stickers or high-fives might not be enough for him, and that's okay[*[18]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Some%20rewards%20that%20motivate%20typically,using%20verbal%20and%20nonverbal%20praise). Many children with ASD respond better to tangible rewards or favorite activities rather than social praise alone[*[19]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=not%20be%20strongly%20motivated%2C%20or,small%20toy%20can%20be%20effective)[*[18]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Some%20rewards%20that%20motivate%20typically,using%20verbal%20and%20nonverbal%20praise). Make a list of his favorites -- for example, you mentioned he loves screen time with educational games (Endless Alphabet/Endless Reading) and the Miss Rachel potty song. These are powerful incentives. We suggest choosing a **couple of specific rewards that he ONLY gets for potty successes**[*[20]*](https://hollandbloorview.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11/ASD-Engage-ATNToiletTrainingGuide.pdf#:~:text=%EF%83%BE%20Identify%20Rewards,the%20toilet%20trip%20is%20over)[*[21]*](https://hollandbloorview.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11/ASD-Engage-ATNToiletTrainingGuide.pdf#:~:text=Use%20rewards,different%20toilets%20in%20different%20places). For instance, you might reserve a particular treat (a small piece of chocolate or cracker) that he loves, **or** allow a brief viewing of the Miss Rachel potty song on your phone **only after** he successfully uses the potty. The key is immediacy and exclusivity: give the reward **right after** he pees or poops in the toilet, and don't give that reward at other times[*[21]*](https://hollandbloorview.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11/ASD-Engage-ATNToiletTrainingGuide.pdf#:~:text=Use%20rewards,different%20toilets%20in%20different%20places). This will make the connection clear: *using the potty = good things happen!* Also prepare lots of **praise** in a form he likes -- some kids enjoy cheering and clapping, others might prefer a happy dance or a hug. Plan to **celebrate every success enthusiastically**, even if it's just a tiny drop in the potty. Positive reinforcement is crucial to keep him motivated[*[22]*](https://raisingchildren.net.au/autism/health-wellbeing/toileting-hygiene/toilet-training-autism#:~:text=If%20you%20praise%20and%20reward,You%20could%20try)[*[23]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Encouragement%20and%20rewards%20Rewards%20and,for%20sitting%20on%20the%20toilet%E2%80%99).

- **Plan the Schedule & Involve Caregivers**: Coordinate with everyone who will be helping (Mom, Dad, grandparents) so they understand the game plan in detail[*[24]*](https://hollandbloorview.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11/ASD-Engage-ATNToiletTrainingGuide.pdf#:~:text=%EF%83%BC%20Use%20the%20same%20words,the%20same%20routine%20and%20language). Consistency is **absolutely vital** for children with ASD -- all caregivers should use the same routine, commands, and rewards so as not to confuse him[*[24]*](https://hollandbloorview.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11/ASD-Engage-ATNToiletTrainingGuide.pdf#:~:text=%EF%83%BC%20Use%20the%20same%20words,the%20same%20routine%20and%20language)[*[25]*](https://raisingchildren.net.au/autism/health-wellbeing/toileting-hygiene/toilet-training-autism#:~:text=System%20,your%20child%20of%20the%20steps). Decide how you will handle the daily schedule. For the intensive training period, he should be **home with an adult's full attention** as much as possible. It's great that he'll be home for two weeks with multiple caregivers available -- you can tag-team so no one gets too worn out. Map out key **routine times** when you'll sit him on the potty: common times are **upon waking**, **20-30 minutes after meals**, **before bath**, and **before sleep**, since kids often naturally need to go at these times. Additionally, plan for **regular intervals** (e.g. start with every 30 minutes or every hour) to take him to try, which we will adjust based on his progress. In the first few days, frequency will be higher (every 20-30 minutes of sitting him on the potty or checking for dryness) to catch as many opportunities as possible[*[26]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=When%20they%20are%20ready%20to,repetition%2C%20they%20will%20understand%20the). As you collect information on how often he's actually peeing, you can fine-tune this interval. Keep a notepad to jot down what times he urinates or has bowel movements; this can help predict his natural schedule. Finally, ensure he's dressed in **easy-to-remove clothing** during training -- avoid buttons, zippers, or anything that takes too long to pull down[*[27]*](https://aimhigheraba.com/toileting-independence-tips-for-successful-potty-training-for-a-child-with-autism/#:~:text=Wear%20Easy%20Clothing). Simple elastic-waist pants or even just underwear and a long T-shirt while at home will make the process smoother for both him and you.

By the end of the preparation phase, your bathroom should be set up, your supplies and rewards in place, and all caregivers ready to implement the plan consistently. You'll also have primed your son by talking about the potty positively, reviewing the picture schedule, and maybe watching fun potty videos (like his favorite Miss Rachel song) together. Now you're ready for the intensive two-week training to begin!

Week 1: Intensive Potty Training Routine
----------------------------------------

During the first week, you'll focus on establishing the potty routine and helping your child understand the connection between the urge to go and the potty. This week is all about **frequency, consistency, and positive experiences**. Expect to invest a lot of time and attention -- essentially a "boot camp" approach with many trips to the bathroom. Keep the atmosphere upbeat and pressure-free; your role is a coach and cheerleader. Below is a breakdown of Week 1 by days:

### Days 1--2: Introduction and Routine Building

**Objective:** Kick off training by removing diapers (except when sleeping) and introducing the new routine in a clear, supportive way. The goal is to familiarize him with sitting on the potty regularly and maybe catch the first successful pee in the toilet.

- **Morning underwear ritual:** On Day 1, when he wakes up, **explain in simple terms that we'll be wearing underwear now because we use the potty like a big kid.** For example, you might say cheerfully, "No more diapers now -- you will pee and poo in the potty!" Keep it very simple and positive. Then put him in clean underwear (or training pants) and some easy pants. Let him feel the underwear and maybe even show him the fun design if any. This helps mark the change. Remind him where the potty is (take him to his potty room and point to the toilet saying "potty"). Since you've been pointing it out already, this is reinforcing that today is the day we start using it.

- **Increased fluids:** To create plenty of opportunities, encourage him to drink liquids throughout the day (within reason). Offer water or his favorite beverages more frequently in the morning. More fluid in means more chances to practice peeing on the potty. Keep an eye that he doesn't overfill and get uncomfortable, but regular sipping is good.

- **Frequent potty trips:** Start a schedule of very **frequent potty sittings**, especially on Day 1. A good starting point is every **30 minutes**. Use a timer if needed to stay consistent. Every 30 minutes, cheerfully announce "Time to go potty!" while showing the potty sign or a picture (consistency in cue is key). Gently guide him to the bathroom. Even if he protests a bit, stay calm and encouraging -- you can make it fun by maybe racing a toy to the bathroom or singing the potty song as you go. When you arrive, help him pull down his pants and underwear (you'll likely do most of this for him at first -- that's okay, we're focusing on the *going* part first[*[28]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=If%20your%20child%20has%20an,than%20to%20achieve%20instant%20success)). Sit him on the potty. Because he's male, you can **teach sitting first** for both pee and poop, which is simpler; standing to pee can be introduced later once he's consistently using the toilet sitting down[*[29]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=the%20inner%20edge%20of%20the,in%20front%20of%20the%20toilet).

- **Keep it short & positive:** Have him **sit for about 3-5 minutes** maximum if he doesn't go. Especially since he's new to this, we don't want him to feel forced to sit forever. Long, unsuccessful sits can feel like punishment or make him antsy[*[30]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=could%20include%20nonverbal%20signing%20or,and%20other%20people%E2%80%99s%20emotional%20responses). Use those few minutes to make the potty a positive place: read a short board book, blow some bubbles, or play his beloved Miss Rachel "It's Potty Time" song. Many children's educators recommend using music or stories to keep a child engaged on the toilet for a few minutes[*[31]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=regular%20times%E2%80%94quite%20frequently%20at%20first,they%20will%20understand%20the%20connection). In your case, playing or singing that Miss Rachel potty song while he's sitting is a great idea -- it's familiar, fun, and directly related to what he's trying to do. You might even reserve that song only for potty time to make it special. While he's sitting, you can also show him the **visual schedule** poster: point to the picture of "sitting on potty" and say "sit on potty," point to the "pee in potty" picture and say your word for pee, etc. This reinforces what you expect in an accessible way[*[16]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=You%20could%20try%20creating%20a,way%2C%20training%20will%20be%20consistent).

- **Success = Big Celebration:** Pay close attention while he's sitting. **If he does pee (or poop) at any point on the potty during these sittings, even by accident, immediately reinforce it**[*[32]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=them%20company%2C%20reading%20to%20them%2C,repetition%2C%20they%20will%20understand%20the). Smile, cheer, clap -- whatever makes him feel proud and happy. Use the **specific word** to label it, like "You peed in the potty! Yay, pee in potty!"[*[32]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=them%20company%2C%20reading%20to%20them%2C,repetition%2C%20they%20will%20understand%20the). You can even incorporate the Miss Rachel song lyrics he likes: "It's potty time!" in a sing-song voice, if that delights him. Right away, give the **agreed reward**: for example, a small piece of his favorite snack or a quick viewing of a fun clip (some parents will literally keep a jar of tiny treats in the bathroom). The immediacy of the reward helps him connect the action with the outcome[*[21]*](https://hollandbloorview.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11/ASD-Engage-ATNToiletTrainingGuide.pdf#:~:text=Use%20rewards,different%20toilets%20in%20different%20places). After a successful pee, also show him the result (let him see the pee in the bowl) and help him flush if he's willing -- many kids love flushing and seeing "bye-bye pee." Some children with ASD are scared of the flush sound; if he is, you can skip flushing until he leaves the room, or use a smaller potty chair to empty later. Use your knowledge of his sensory preferences here. In any case, give lots of **verbal praise and hugs** as you help him off the potty, wipe, and pull up pants. **Positive reinforcement for any success is crucial** to encourage repeat behavior[*[22]*](https://raisingchildren.net.au/autism/health-wellbeing/toileting-hygiene/toilet-training-autism#:~:text=If%20you%20praise%20and%20reward,You%20could%20try)[*[23]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Encouragement%20and%20rewards%20Rewards%20and,for%20sitting%20on%20the%20toilet%E2%80%99).

- **If nothing happens:** If he doesn't pee in that 5-minute window (which is very possible on the first tries), that's okay. Keep your tone casual and encouraging: "No pee this time -- we'll try again soon." Let him hop off, pull up his pants, and go back to play. Avoid showing disappointment. The goal these first couple days is just to get him used to the process.

- **Watch for cues between trips:** Even with a tight schedule, accidents can happen in between. Keep a close eye on him for any **signs of needing to go**: fidgeting, getting quiet or still suddenly, grabbing at his diaper area, or in his case **running to hide** (since you noted he tends to hide before pooping)[*[33]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=If%20they%20do%20not%20overtly,prove%20more%20effective%20than%20praise). The *moment* you see any such cue, gently and quickly escort him to the potty. For example, if you notice him retreating to a closet or corner, calmly say "Let's go potty!" and lead him to the bathroom right away. He may start pooping as he hides -- still, pick him up and place him on the toilet if possible to let him finish there. Even if you catch it late, this reinforces that poop belongs in the potty.

- **Handling accidents calmly:** Accidents are inevitable, especially early on. **Do not scold or punish** him for wetting or soiling his underwear -- this can create anxiety and setbacks[*[2]*](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/1015/p468.html#:~:text=Throughout%20training%2C%20parents%20should%20remain,1). Instead, handle it neutrally: if you notice he's had an accident (wet pants, puddle on floor), calmly say a one-word or simple phrase like "Wet" or "Uh oh, peepee is wet"[*[4]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=to%20the%20concept%20of%20potty,to%20go%2C%20and%20so%20on) in a matter-of-fact voice. Immediately guide him to the bathroom and sit him on the potty, even if he's already finished peeing. This routine teaches cause and effect. You can even dump any collected poop from the underwear into the toilet to show "poop goes in potty." Have him participate by **helping with cleanup in a minor way**, like handing you a wipe or putting the wet clothes in a laundry bin. This is a tip from some intensive methods: the idea is not to shame him, but to involve him just enough that he starts to understand that accidents have a clean-up process (and it's much more fun to get a reward for doing it in the potty instead!). After changing him into dry clothes, reiterate positively, "Next time, pee goes in the potty." Then move on -- don't dwell on the accident. Remember to also periodically check his underwear for dryness and **praise him for staying dry** between trips ("Dry pants, good job!")[*[34]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=schedule,on%20other%20activities%20between%20visits)[*[4]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=to%20the%20concept%20of%20potty,to%20go%2C%20and%20so%20on). Praising dryness helps him value staying clean and dry, and turns attention to the positive.

- **Consistency through Day 2:** Continue this routine through Day 1 and Day 2. You may feel a bit tethered to the bathroom -- that's normal at the start. Try to make it fun for both of you: use silly songs (the potty song), make his favorite toys "participate" (e.g. "Teddy needs to go potty, let's take Teddy!" and have the stuffed animal sit nearby), and give lots of affection. By Day 2, he should be getting more accustomed to the drill. You might start noticing patterns -- maybe he always pees about 10 minutes after a big drink, or he tends to poop in the late afternoon. Use those observations to slightly adjust your schedule (for instance, if you notice he consistently pees 45 minutes after a drink, you might time a potty sit at that 45-minute mark).

**Tip:** It takes time for a child with ASD to connect this new routine. Don't be discouraged if Day 1 and 2 are mostly accidents. The focus is on *exposure* and routine-building now. You are showing him repeatedly: *this is what we do when we feel the urge -- we go to this room, pull down pants, sit, etc.* Even if he isn't consciously holding or releasing on the toilet yet, he's absorbing the sequence through repetition. Keep the faith and stick with the schedule[*[35]*](https://hollandbloorview.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11/ASD-Engage-ATNToiletTrainingGuide.pdf#:~:text=%EF%83%BE%20Schedule,same%20goal%20for%203%20weeks) -- consistency now will pay off in the coming days.

### Days 3--5: Building Understanding and Consistency

**Objective:** In the middle of Week 1, you will continue frequent scheduled potty trips but can start adjusting timing based on his patterns. These days are about helping him make the connection and starting to see more successes. You'll also introduce more communication around potty and continue reinforcing every small step.

- **Adjust intervals as needed:** By Day 3, assess how the first two days went. If he was having **very frequent accidents (every 20 minutes or so)**, you might *continue with a high frequency* of potty trips (every 20-30 minutes) to catch one. If instead you noticed he often stayed dry for an hour or more, you can gently extend the interval to **45 minutes or 1 hour** between sits[*[3]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Your%20first%20step%20is%20to,which%20may%20interfere%20with%20training). The goal is to hit a sweet spot where he is taken to the potty **before** he has an accident, but also not so often that he's annoyed. For many toddlers, hourly sits are a good rhythm once they start getting the idea. Also continue to leverage natural timing: always after a meal or big drink, and watch for those cues like hiding or dancing around.

- **Maintain the routine and cues:** Keep using the **same words, signs, and visual schedule** consistently for each potty trip. For example, every time say "Let's go potty" (or your chosen phrase), show the potty picture, and guide him to the bathroom[*[13]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Use%20specific%20language,be%20confusing%20for%20children%20with)[*[36]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=describe%20the%20toilet%20%E2%80%93%20potty%2C,as%20if%20she%E2%80%99s%20being%20punished). Autistic children benefit from this predictability -- soon he'll know exactly what to expect when you say those words[*[16]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=You%20could%20try%20creating%20a,way%2C%20training%20will%20be%20consistent). Continue to narrate simply: "Pants down, sit on potty, pee in potty, all done, flush, wash hands" each time, pointing to pictures. This repetition helps him gradually understand the full routine.

- **Reinforce any progress:** By now, he might be starting to urinate in the potty occasionally -- perhaps you caught one or two pees in the toilet on Day 1--2, or maybe Day 3 is the first time it "clicks." **The first time he successfully pees in the potty is a huge milestone.** Make sure the reward is something he truly loves (for example, if you've been using small treats each time, maybe he gets an *extra* helping or a bigger reward the first few times to really celebrate). You can also use social praise that is meaningful to him: if he likes cheering, literally give him a round of applause and say "I'm so proud of you!" If he's more motivated by visuals, you could put a fun sticker on a chart together as an additional reward (some kids enjoy seeing a row of stickers grow as they succeed)[*[22]*](https://raisingchildren.net.au/autism/health-wellbeing/toileting-hygiene/toilet-training-autism#:~:text=If%20you%20praise%20and%20reward,You%20could%20try). The idea is to make potty successes *very* rewarding and accidents low-key.

- **Gradually involve him in the process:** As he becomes more familiar with going to the bathroom, you can **start teaching small steps of independence one at a time** (but do not overwhelm him by expecting everything at once[*[28]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=If%20your%20child%20has%20an,than%20to%20achieve%20instant%20success)). For example, around Day 3 or 4, you might encourage him to help pull down his own pants or underwear when it's potty time. You can place your hands over his to guide the motion. If that's too hard, you do it but maybe have him **flush the toilet** after, since many kids find flushing fun and it gives him a sense of participation. Another step: have him practice **hand washing** with help after each attempt, even if nothing happened -- this builds the complete routine early (plus, it's good hygiene). Take these self-help steps slowly; the priority is still getting him to pee/poop in the potty, but introducing these elements keeps him engaged and learning.

- **Communication and signals:** Around these days, emphasize a way for him to signal you (even if he doesn't actually start doing it yet). For instance, every time you take him, you might gently hold his hand and have him touch the picture of the toilet on his visual schedule, or prompt him to make the potty sign you chose. Say the phrase, *"Potty. You tell Mommy when you need potty by doing [sign] (or by saying 'potty')."* He may not initiate this yet, but over time he can learn. The HealthyChildren (AAP) guidance suggests using a **single gesture or sign for potty-related words** if verbal skills are limited[*[4]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=to%20the%20concept%20of%20potty,to%20go%2C%20and%20so%20on), so continue modeling that. You mentioned he hums or sings "It's potty time" -- this is wonderful, because it shows he's associating the concept. You might encourage that: before heading to the bathroom, start singing that tune to cue him. Eventually, *him* singing or humming it could become *his* way of signaling the need!

- **Using his interests as rewards:** Don't hesitate to get creative with motivators. For example, since he loves letters and numbers, you could incorporate that into the reward system. Perhaps every time he successfully goes, he gets a new foam letter for the bath, or a magnet letter to put on a board. Or play a quick alphabet game on a tablet as a reward. The AAP notes that for children with developmental delays, identifying *what they are most passionate about* is key, and using those as potty rewards can be more effective than praise alone[*[33]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=If%20they%20do%20not%20overtly,prove%20more%20effective%20than%20praise). So if Miss Rachel songs are his passion, lean into that. If he's really into a certain toy (like toy cars or puzzle pieces), you can use those: e.g., each potty success earns a new puzzle piece until he completes a picture. This keeps him engaged in the process.

- **Dealing with bowel movements:** Pay special attention to pooping habits during these days. Some children (autistic or not) have a harder time learning to poop in the toilet than to pee. He already shows a clear behavior of hiding to poop in his diaper. Our goal is to transition that behavior to hiding in the *bathroom* or using the potty for privacy. To facilitate this, watch him closely around his usual poop time (many kids go once a day, often after a meal like breakfast or dinner). When you see him start to go to his hiding spot or notice that telltale posture (squatting, grunting)[*[37]*](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/1015/p468.html#:~:text=Facial%20expressions%2C%20postures%2C%20words%2C%20or,to%2026%20months%20of%20age), calmly intervene: "You need to poop -- let's go to the potty." Take him to the bathroom. It might help to **give him privacy** there if that's what he seeks -- for example, you could turn away or step just outside the open door while he's on the potty (making sure he's safe) to mimic the feeling of "hiding." You can also offer a favorite small **activity to relax him on the potty for poop**, like looking at a picture book or blowing bubbles, since some children get anxious about this new way of pooping. If he has an accident and poops in his underwear, do the same as with pee accidents: stay calm, clean up without fuss, and briefly sit him on the potty after dumping the stool into it. Say "poop goes in the potty" gently. Many kids take longer to consistently poop in the toilet; if he's resistant, do not force or panic. Positive reinforcement and patience are your tools. Some parents find a **reward hierarchy** helps -- for instance, a small treat for peeing, but a slightly more exciting reward for pooping in the potty, to incentivize that tougher skill. You could consider this if he seems to withhold or prefer the diaper for poop.

- **Tracking progress:** By Day 5, pause to assess how far you've come. Perhaps he's now urinating in the potty several times a day with reminders, or at least more comfortable with the routine. You might still be catching him mostly by schedule rather than him initiating -- that's expected at this stage. **Celebrate the progress** (no matter how small) with your family and with him. For example, "You've been wearing underwear all week! I'm so proud of how you sit on the potty like a big boy." This encouragement keeps morale up for the second week. If you find that he is *still* having very frequent accidents with almost no success by Day 5, consider if any tweaks are needed: Are you catching his cues or timing right? Is he perhaps not ready after all? (Signs of not ready would be distress with the process or zero improvement despite consistency.) Most likely, though, with the groundwork laid, you will have seen at least some improvement (like maybe he's staying dry 1-2 hours at a stretch when you remind him to go, whereas before he'd soak diapers without awareness).

**Tip:** Stay patient and **keep the tone positive**, even if progress is slower than hoped. Avoid showing frustration in front of him. If you feel yourself burning out, allow another caregiver to take over for a bit. Remember, children with ASD often need extra time and support to learn this skill, but they *do* get there[*[38]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Despite%20challenges%2C%20most%20children%20with,therapist%20or%20a%20rehabilitation%20engineer)[*[7]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Most%20children%20with%20a%20developmental,of%20the%20need%20to%20go). Consistency in these early days is critical -- you are establishing habits that likely need around 2-3 weeks to really take hold[*[39]*](https://hollandbloorview.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11/ASD-Engage-ATNToiletTrainingGuide.pdf#:~:text=trips%20around%20your%20usual%20routine,may%20help%20your%20child%20know). You're already halfway through Week 1 -- keep up the great work!

### Days 6--7: Reinforcement and Routine Mastery

**Objective:** By the end of Week 1, aim for a more established routine with fewer accidents. Your child should now be familiar with what's expected. You will continue all the strategies, but can begin gently encouraging a bit more independence and maybe test the waters with a short outing or training in a new environment for generalization.

- **By now:** Ideally, by Day 6 or 7 your son is having **more successes than accidents** each day (even if he isn't initiating on his own yet). For example, perhaps he's staying dry most of the day *as long as* you take him to the potty on schedule, and he's able to release urine on the toilet when he does sit. If that's the case, congratulations -- the routine is working as a supportive scaffold for him[*[40]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=The%20best%20solution%20to%20this,on%20other%20activities%20between%20visits). He may not fully understand the internal signals yet, but he's becoming conditioned to use the potty at regular times, which is a big step forward. If accidents are still frequent, don't lose hope -- continue the plan into Week 2, and consider consulting your pediatrician or an autism specialist for advice if needed.

- **Gradually lengthen the interval (if appropriate):** If he's consistently staying dry between those 45-minute or hour checks, you can experiment with slightly **longer intervals** to encourage him to hold it a bit and possibly start recognizing his urge. For instance, move to 1.5 hours if he's been dry at 1 hour consistently. However, **do not stretch too long** and set him up for an accident; err on the side of taking him more often if unsure. The priority is to keep reinforcing success and the habit of using the toilet. Some experts recommend a regular schedule (like at the top of every hour) for children with developmental delays, to make it a routine that doesn't rely on them initiating[*[40]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=The%20best%20solution%20to%20this,on%20other%20activities%20between%20visits). Find a balance that keeps him dry but also isn't interrupting him every 15 minutes unnecessarily.

- **Increasing child's participation:** This is a good time to have him take on a bit more if he's ready. For example, work on **pants management** more intentionally: help him pull down his own underwear and trousers when it's potty time, and pull them back up after. Use a lot of praise for any attempt he makes ("Great job pushing your pants down!"). If he has trouble with coordination, you might give physical guidance or even try having him practice with looser pants at a non-potty time as a separate "game." Also, have him be more involved in **handwashing**: guide his hands through the steps of soaping and rinsing. These help reinforce the routine sequence and give him a sense of accomplishment. Remember to **teach one new skill at a time** so as not to overwhelm[*[28]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=If%20your%20child%20has%20an,than%20to%20achieve%20instant%20success). If he's still mastering the basic "pee in potty" part, it's fine to hold off on other steps until Week 2 or beyond.

- **Sustaining motivation:** Continue with the **reward system**, but you might start adjusting it if he's "getting it." For example, if he's earning a small treat every single time initially, by the end of the week you could begin to **fade the reward slightly** for pees -- maybe switch to a token or sticker that leads to a reward after a few successes, while still immediately praising each time[*[41]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=with%20ASD,He)[*[42]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=watch%20your%20child%E2%80%99s%20response,But). However, if he's very motivated by the current rewards and you fear losing momentum, you can keep them going longer. For many autistic children, consistent reinforcement is helpful for quite a while[*[43]*](https://aimhigheraba.com/toileting-independence-tips-for-successful-potty-training-for-a-child-with-autism/#:~:text=Use%20Positive%20Reinforcement). You might continue the high-value rewards for *poops* if that's still a challenging area, and use more verbal praise or a smaller reward for pees once he's doing them regularly. Do what keeps him eager to participate.

- **Addressing any emerging challenges:** Toward the end of Week 1, you might see some new behaviors. For instance, some kids start **testing limits**, refusing to sit occasionally, or getting upset about stopping play to go potty. If he resists going to the potty when you prompt, try using a gentle **"first-then" visual prompt**: e.g., show a card or use words "First potty, *then* [favorite activity]"[*[44]*](https://aimhigheraba.com/toileting-independence-tips-for-successful-potty-training-for-a-child-with-autism/#:~:text=,the%20need%20for%20the%20toilet). This reminds him that a preferred activity is coming right after he tries. Keep the vibe upbeat: "I know you're playing, but first potty, then back to play!" If he's very upset, you can wait a few minutes and try again, or possibly he truly doesn't need to go right that second. By now you know his patterns better, so you can be a bit flexible if, say, he just went 20 minutes ago and is resisting -- in that case, you might delay the next sit a little. Use your judgement, but maintain overall consistency. If he has an accident because you waited, just note it for next time.

- **Generalizing to other bathrooms:** A big part of potty training is teaching kids they can use toilets **outside of their main bathroom**. Children with ASD may strongly prefer the familiar environment and routine, so it helps to practice early in different settings to avoid rigidity[*[45]*](https://hollandbloorview.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11/ASD-Engage-ATNToiletTrainingGuide.pdf#:~:text=rewards%20are%20special,4). As you near the end of Week 1 (or during Week 2), consider doing a **"field trip" to another bathroom** in the house or a relative's house just to practice. For example, if he normally uses the powder room, one day try taking him to the bathroom in mom and dad's room or another one in the home. Use the same visual schedule and routine. He might be confused at first -- that's normal -- but gently explain "This is a potty too, we can pee here." If he succeeds there, great! If not, no biggie; you can try again later. Similarly, you might let him **observe a family member or another child** (if possible) using the toilet, to reinforce by imitation[*[46]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Begin%20bringing%20them%20to%20the,how%20the%20potty%20is%20used). Many children learn by watching others. If he has a playdate or you have an older child who doesn't mind, seeing another kid use the potty can make the concept more concrete to him[*[46]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Begin%20bringing%20them%20to%20the,how%20the%20potty%20is%20used).

- **Optional brief outing:** If by Day 7 he has shown some reliability (e.g., he stayed dry the last two days except maybe one accident), you could attempt a short outing as a "test run" -- maybe a quick walk around the block or a trip to a nearby park for half an hour. Use a pull-up over his underwear or bring a change of clothes just in case. Take him to the potty **right before leaving** the house[*[47]*](https://aimhigheraba.com/toileting-independence-tips-for-successful-potty-training-for-a-child-with-autism/#:~:text=Bring%20a%20portable%20potty%20or,consistent%20reminders%20during%20your%20trip). While out, keep the outing short enough that you likely won't need a bathroom (or if you do, you're close to home). The purpose is to begin teaching him that the expectation to stay dry applies everywhere, not just at home. When you return, take him straight to the potty as well. If he stayed dry the whole outing, give big praise for that ("You kept your underwear dry, good job!"). If he did have an accident outside, don't worry or scold -- it can be trickier outside the home environment. Just treat it calmly, and note if maybe he got nervous or distracted. Longer outings and public bathrooms will be a focus later; there's no rush to conquer that in the first week.

By the end of Week 1, **ideally** your toddler is following the potty routine with minimal fuss, urinating on the potty when taken at routine times, and perhaps even initiating a few times with subtle cues (like going toward the bathroom on his own or using the potty sign). He may still require your reminders and assistance for all steps -- that's expected. The groundwork has been laid. Now it's time to consolidate these gains and push toward more independence in Week 2.

Week 2: Increasing Independence and Mastery
-------------------------------------------

During the second week, the focus shifts to reinforcing the habits learned and encouraging your child to take more initiative. You will still maintain routine and supervision, but you might scale back the constant prompts slightly to test his ability to respond to internal cues. This week is also about troubleshooting remaining issues and preparing to transition back to daycare with his new skills.

### Days 8--11: Fading Prompts and Noticing Signals

**Objective:** Give your child slightly more space to recognize his own need to go, while still preventing failures. Encourage him to use his communication tools. Continue consistent routine but begin to **fade the intensity of prompts** very gradually.

- **Still scheduled, but encourage initiative:** Keep up the established schedule (morning, after meals, etc.), but now you can **occasionally ask him if he needs to go** instead of simply telling him. For example, every so often (perhaps once in the morning and once in afternoon) try **prompting with a question or gesture**: "Do you need potty?" and show him the potty picture or sign. If he doesn't respond or seems unsure, proceed to take him as usual. If he **does** run toward the bathroom or give an affirmative sign/sound, that's fantastic -- support that initiative immediately by saying "Okay, let's go!" and heading to the toilet. Many ASD toddlers won't consistently self-report at this stage (some take months to initiate reliably), so think of this as practice for him. You're teaching him that it's his body and he can let you know when he feels something.

- **Watch for initiation behaviors:** Be extra attentive to any new behaviors that might indicate he needs to go. Perhaps now that he's used to the potty, instead of hiding in a closet to poop, he might start **walking toward the bathroom or toward you when he needs to poop** -- even if he doesn't say anything. He might also get your attention in his own way (bringing you a certain toy or just fussing). Treat any such action as a possible potty request. It's better to take him for a false alarm than to miss a cue. If you catch him heading into the bathroom on his own, **follow him and praise him**: "You're going to the potty, great idea! Let's do it." Support even the smallest hint of independence.

- **Continue visuals and language:** Don't drop the support tools yet. Keep using the visual schedule each time (by now he might be "reading" it himself -- some kids will point to the next picture themselves). Continue to consistently say your potty routine phrases. Using clear, **specific language** remains important: e.g. when he's on the toilet, saying "Okay, try to pee" or "push the poop out" (whichever is relevant) can help him focus on what to do[*[13]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Use%20specific%20language,be%20confusing%20for%20children%20with). If he does pee, reinforce verbally "You peed in the potty, that's what we do when we feel pee pee" -- this reinforces cause and effect. Keep any language **positive or neutral**, never negative about accidents[*[2]*](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/1015/p468.html#:~:text=Throughout%20training%2C%20parents%20should%20remain,1). If he's dry say "you're dry, yay!"; if he's wet, just matter-of-fact "you're wet, next time potty."

- **Rewards: maintain or tweak:** By the second week, you might have a good sense of what rewards are truly motivating him. If the novelty of a reward has worn off, consider spicing it up. For instance, if you were giving a small piece of cookie each time and he's losing interest, maybe switch to a different treat or a token towards screen time. Some families use a **token system** now: each potty success earns a token, and trade a certain number of tokens for a bigger reward like 10 minutes of an iPad game later. However, be cautious -- at not-quite-3 years old, he might not grasp delayed gratification well. Immediate rewards usually work best for toddlers[*[21]*](https://hollandbloorview.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11/ASD-Engage-ATNToiletTrainingGuide.pdf#:~:text=Use%20rewards,different%20toilets%20in%20different%20places). So you might simply keep using immediate small rewards through Week 2, especially since ASD kids often benefit from consistent reinforcement longer. **Praise and encouragement** should still be abundant, though by now using a normal happy tone (versus over-the-top every time) is fine as he expects success as the norm. Essentially, continue to **reward each success**, but you can be a bit more selective -- for example, perhaps only give the treat for **initiated** potty use or for poops, while giving high-fives and praise for routine prompted pees. Adjust this balance in a way that keeps him motivated.

- **Nap and night considerations:** Around this time, consider what to do for naps or nighttime. Many children, especially those under 3, are **not developmentally ready to stay dry at night**, and nighttime training is typically attempted much later (months or even years after daytime)[*[48]*](https://aimhigheraba.com/toileting-independence-tips-for-successful-potty-training-for-a-child-with-autism/#:~:text=Nighttime%20Training%20Challenges). So it's perfectly fine to keep using a diaper or pull-up at night and possibly at nap. You can still incorporate potty into the **pre-sleep routine**: have him sit on the potty before nap and bedtime. Often, this catches a pee and helps him stay drier longer during sleep. If you notice his nap diapers are dry when he wakes, that's a great sign -- you could trial naps in underwear toward end of Week 2, but only if he's been consistently dry during the nap in the diaper. For now, focus on **daytime training**, and don't worry about nights. Just mention to him in a simple way that he wears a "sleep diaper" but in the morning the potty routine starts again. This can avoid confusion. Make sure to change him into underwear first thing in the morning to reinforce the daytime routine.

### Days 12--14: Practicing in Real-Life Scenarios and Wrap-Up

**Objective:** In the final days of the two-week period, solidify your child's potty skills and prepare to sustain this progress going forward. Practice potty use outside the home or with different caregivers, and address any remaining hurdles. By Day 14, your toddler may not be accident-free 100% of the time (that's okay!), but he should be well on his way -- understanding the process, staying dry for longer periods, and cooperating with using the toilet regularly.

- **Outing to public restroom:** Choose one of these final days to do a deliberate short outing that involves using a bathroom outside of your house. For example, you might take him to a familiar, low-key location like Grandma's house or a children's play center -- someplace you know has a clean, accessible restroom or where he's comfortable. **Plan ahead:** pack a "potty bag" with spare clothes, wipes, a travel potty seat (if he's scared of large toilets, a folding seat or small potty in the car can be handy), and a few reward treats. Take him to the potty right before leaving home. At the destination, after a bit of play or at his usual interval, calmly say "Let's use the potty here." Bring along his visual schedule or a travel version of it if possible (some parents keep a mini picture sequence in their bag). Expect that a **new bathroom might throw him off** -- many autistic kids are uneasy with unfamiliar restrooms due to different acoustics, lighting, or the echo of hand dryers[*[49]*](https://aimhigheraba.com/toileting-independence-tips-for-successful-potty-training-for-a-child-with-autism/#:~:text=Introducing%20Public%20Restrooms). Ease him into it: you can even visit the restroom once just to look without insisting he go, then leave and come back later to try. When trying, follow the same routine (pants down, sit, etc.). **Keep it very positive and calm**. If he manages to pee in a public or different toilet, celebrate extra big -- this is a huge generalization win. If he refuses or is too anxious, don't force it; you can leave and try again another time. The exposure alone is progress. Over time, gradually introduce him to more public bathrooms, starting with quiet ones and working up to louder, busy ones, always offering comfort and praise[*[50]*](https://aimhigheraba.com/toileting-independence-tips-for-successful-potty-training-for-a-child-with-autism/#:~:text=trip).

- **Caregiver consistency:** During these days, have other caregivers actively practice the routine with him if they haven't been already. For example, let Dad or a grandparent take the lead on a whole afternoon of potty intervals, using the same words and methods. This is important so that your son doesn't become dependent on only one person for potty time. He should learn that with *any* trusted adult, the same routine applies[*[24]*](https://hollandbloorview.ca/sites/default/files/2020-11/ASD-Engage-ATNToiletTrainingGuide.pdf#:~:text=%EF%83%BC%20Use%20the%20same%20words,the%20same%20routine%20and%20language). Brief the daycare as well (even if he's not there these two weeks, you'll want to share his progress). You can write a short summary for his teachers about what cues and schedule you've been using, so they can maintain the training when he returns. **Consistency across settings and people will cement his learning**[*[51]*](https://aimhigheraba.com/toileting-independence-tips-for-successful-potty-training-for-a-child-with-autism/#:~:text=Ensuring%20Consistency%20Across%20Settings). If possible, have one of his daycare staff or therapists (if he has one) observe or practice with him once before he goes back, so they know how to handle it.

- **Address remaining challenges:** Evaluate if there are any persistent issues. Common ones by the end of an initial training period might include:

- **Stool withholding or constipation:** Some kids hold in poop due to anxiety about using the toilet. If you notice he hasn't pooped in a couple of days or seems to be withholding, focus on making him comfortable -- ensure he's got a footrest for leverage, maybe give him a favorite book or *more privacy* during poop attempts. Keep his diet high in fiber and offer plenty of fluids[*[52]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=is%20about%20to%20pee%20or,which%20may%20interfere%20with%20training)[*[8]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Get%20your%20child%20familiar%20with,Page%203%2F5). A small reward specifically for pooping in the potty can be helpful (e.g., a special toy or treat he only gets for that). If constipation becomes an issue, consult the pediatrician; sometimes a gentle laxative is used temporarily during potty training to make poops softer and harder to hold, but only do this with medical guidance.

- **Fear of the toilet or bathroom:** If he still shows fear of certain aspects (like the flushing noise or sitting without you holding him), continue to work on desensitization. For flush fear, you might let him flush after you go to demonstrate it's not scary (some kids even enjoy flushing when it's not their own business, as a game). For fear of sitting, ensure the seat is secure (which it is with your setup) and perhaps let him decorate his potty area with fun stickers or have a special toy he holds while sitting. The idea is to make the bathroom a safe, even enjoyable, space. You've already done a great job with making it kid-friendly.

- **Accidents during specific times:** Maybe he's great when naked or just in underwear at home, but if you put pants on, he has accidents, or maybe he's fine all day but wets in the late evening when tired. Identify any pattern. If clothing is an issue, let him practice potty with clothes on (e.g., do some drills where he pulls down and back up, so he's used to that extra step). If timing is an issue (like end-of-day fatigue), maybe add one extra prompted potty trip during that period. If he always has a small accident before making it to the toilet (a common thing where a few drops come out on the way), remind him to try and *tell* you a little earlier; that will improve as he gains control.

- **One step at a time:** Recall that children with developmental delays often need to master one component at a time[*[28]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=If%20your%20child%20has%20an,than%20to%20achieve%20instant%20success). By the end of two weeks, the primary focus is on *where* to pee/poop (in the potty) and *keeping underwear dry*. Don't worry if he still needs help with wiping, clothing, or washing hands -- those skills will come with practice in the coming weeks. It's perfectly fine if an adult is still doing most of the process; he is learning the most critical part: recognizing the urge and using the toilet.

-   **Consistency going forward:** Plan how to continue reinforcing his progress after Day 14. Potty training doesn't end abruptly -- you'll want to maintain the routines and gradually relax them as he shows more independence. For instance, if by day 14 he's mostly accident-free with prompting, you'll continue a similar schedule for the next month or two, slowly letting him take the lead more. If he regresses or has a bad day, respond with patience and simply go back to basics for a little while. **Never punish regressions** -- they can happen, especially if he's upset or sick[*[2]*](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/1015/p468.html#:~:text=Throughout%20training%2C%20parents%20should%20remain,1). Instead, calmly remind and support him. Also, be prepared for changes like going back to daycare or a new routine to cause a few accidents; communicate with his teachers to keep training consistent there (provide them with his visual schedule, reward system if feasible, etc.[*[51]*](https://aimhigheraba.com/toileting-independence-tips-for-successful-potty-training-for-a-child-with-autism/#:~:text=Ensuring%20Consistency%20Across%20Settings)). The more his potty routine stays the same across environments, the quicker he will fully train.
-   **Celebrate success:** Finally, acknowledge how far he (and you) have come in two weeks. Maybe make a fun **"Potty Champion" certificate or a big celebratory dance** on day 14 to mark the occasion. Even if he's not 100% accident-free yet, if he has made significant strides (like wearing underwear all day, using the potty with prompts, maybe even telling you once or twice when he had to go), that is a *huge* achievement -- especially for a child with ASD in a short time. Reinforce his pride in being a "big boy." Some parents even do a small gift at the end of a successful week or two of training -- you could give him a new toy he's been wanting, with the explanation that it's because he did so well learning to use the potty. Positive reinforcement can be extended in this way to cap off the training period.

Additional Tips and Reminders
-----------------------------

- **Stay Patient and Positive:** This cannot be overstated. Potty training an autistic toddler can test your patience, but remaining **calm, upbeat, and supportive** is key. If you or the child become too stressed, it's okay to step back. In fact, experts advise that if toilet training turns into a battle with no progress, it's wise to **take a break and try again a bit later**, rather than forcing the issue[*[53]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=If%20toilet%20training%20becomes%20a,that%20your%20child%20isn%E2%80%99t%20ready). A short break (a few weeks or months) can reset the mood. Hopefully, with the two-week intensive approach, you'll see progress, but keep this in mind if things ever plateau badly.

- **Use Concrete Reinforcements over Abstract:** Children with ASD may not respond to generic praise like "What a big boy" as much as neurotypical kids[*[54]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=deficit%20%2Fhyperactivity%20disorder%20%28ADHD%29%20,small%20toy%20can%20be%20effective). Instead, use very concrete feedback: "Your pants are dry, good job!" or "You peed in the potty, you earned a sticker!" This helps him directly understand what he did right. Tangible rewards (stickers, small toys, a favorite video clip) often have more impact than words alone[*[19]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=not%20be%20strongly%20motivated%2C%20or,small%20toy%20can%20be%20effective), so don't shy away from using them, especially in the early stages.

- **Sensory Considerations:** We touched on this, but always be mindful of sensory factors. If he hates the feeling of wiping, try using unscented, soft flushable wipes instead of regular toilet paper at first. If the sound of the bathroom fan or flush is startling, maybe turn off the fan during potty time or have him wear ear protectors. Some kids are bothered by the smell of cleaning products -- use mild, child-friendly cleaners in the bathroom. Basically, try to remove any sensory obstacle that could make him avoid the bathroom[*[55]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=learning%20process,away%20from%20the%20noisy%20toilet)[*[56]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Sensory%20overload%20If%20your%20child,the%20rest%20of%20the%20house). Conversely, you can *add* sensory comforts: perhaps a little squishy toy to hold while sitting, or a familiar scent (like hand soap he likes) to make the environment pleasant.

- **Routine, Routine, Routine:** Children with autism often thrive on routines and predictability[*[57]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Many%20find%20it%20extremely%20difficult,unfamiliar%20surroundings%20of%20the%20bathroom). Make the potty routine a part of daily life just like bedtime or mealtime. The HealthyChildren experts advise putting the child on a **regular potty schedule** -- for some kids that means even if they don't ask, you take them at set times every day[*[40]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=The%20best%20solution%20to%20this,on%20other%20activities%20between%20visits). This removes the burden from them always initiating and helps form a habit. Over time, this habitual use can lead to them initiating naturally when they feel the urge, because their body is used to the schedule. In your two-week plan, you've essentially done this by scheduling frequent trips. Continue to have a structure to his day that always includes potty breaks (e.g., "we always sit on the potty after lunch and before going outside," etc.). This will help him feel secure and know what's expected.

- **One skill at a time:** Remember that potty training isn't just one skill -- it's actually a *complex chain* of skills (recognizing the urge, getting to the bathroom, manipulating clothes, voiding on cue, wiping, flushing, handwashing)[*[58]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=Going%20to%20the%20toilet%20is,try%20a%20combination%20of%20approaches). It's a lot for any toddler, let alone one with communication challenges. The approach we've taken is to focus first on the core skills: **recognizing the urge and successfully using the toilet for elimination**. The other pieces (pulling up pants, wiping, etc.) can be layered in gradually once the core skill is in place[*[28]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=If%20your%20child%20has%20an,than%20to%20achieve%20instant%20success). So don't feel discouraged if, for example, he still needs you to undress him or if he hasn't mastered wiping -- that's normal at 2-3 years old. Those things will improve with practice and maturity. You might target them one-by-one in the coming weeks (maybe work on pulling pants up/down independently in Week 3, then work on teaching him to wipe front to back for pee in Week 4, and so on).

- **Nighttime training:** As noted, nighttime dryness is a different ballgame physiologically. Many children's bodies aren't ready to stay dry all night until much older (even 5-7 years old for some, especially in ASD where development can be uneven). Focus on daytime first. You can periodically check his night diaper in the morning; if it's often dry, you could attempt night training down the line. For now, using nighttime pull-ups is fine. To help nights along gently, do limit fluids an hour before bed, have a set **bathroom trip at bedtime**, and maybe even do a "dream pee" where you carry him to the potty once before you go to bed. But these are optional and only if he's comfortable -- not necessary within these two weeks.

- **Expect and manage setbacks:** It's common for kids, especially those on the spectrum, to have ups and downs. He might do great for three days and then suddenly have multiple accidents on day four -- this doesn't mean training failed. It could be due to a change in routine, not feeling well, or just testing boundaries. Stay consistent and positive through accidents, and he will get back on track. If he starts to protest the potty strongly at any point, try to figure out why (Is he bored? Does he want more control? Is something scaring him?). Adjust if needed -- for instance, give him a bit more say ("Which potty song should we sing?" or let him choose a sticker each time). **Never punish or yell** for accidents or resistance[*[2]*](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/1015/p468.html#:~:text=Throughout%20training%2C%20parents%20should%20remain,1). As frustrating as it can be, a calm approach will resolve issues faster. If you ever feel anger or frustration, take a breather and remind yourself that he's learning an important life skill and *wants* to do well -- he just needs help to get there.

Conclusion
----------

Potty training a toddler with autism and speech delays in a two-week period is an ambitious task, but with the structured, compassionate approach outlined above, it's certainly possible to make tremendous progress. Throughout this guide, we leveraged expert recommendations -- from the American Academy of Pediatrics' emphasis on readiness and positive reinforcement, to autism specialists' tips on visual supports and routine -- to create a plan tailored to your son's needs[*[4]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=to%20the%20concept%20of%20potty,to%20go%2C%20and%20so%20on)[*[16]*](https://www.wvmc.com.au/documents/Toilet-Training-and-Autism.pdf#:~:text=You%20could%20try%20creating%20a,way%2C%20training%20will%20be%20consistent).

By maintaining a consistent schedule, using simple language and signs, and wholeheartedly celebrating every success, you are helping your child form new habits and confidence around using the toilet. The dedicated potty area you set up, his favorite potty song, and the rewards system all create a supportive learning environment where he can thrive. Remember that while two weeks of intensive practice will set a strong foundation, continued consistency in the coming weeks will solidify his skills. Most children with special needs *can* be toilet trained, but they may require a bit more time and patience[*[38]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Despite%20challenges%2C%20most%20children%20with,therapist%20or%20a%20rehabilitation%20engineer)[*[7]*](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/toilet-training-children-with-special-needs.aspx#:~:text=Most%20children%20with%20a%20developmental,of%20the%20need%20to%20go). Progress might be gradual, but **every small step is a victory** -- whether it's sitting on the potty calmly, signing "potty," or staying dry for half a day.

As you conclude the two-week training period, take pride in the achievements both you and your son have made. He is learning an essential independence skill that will serve him for life, and you are strengthening communication and trust with him through this process. If there are still areas to work on, that's okay -- you now have the tools and understanding to continue guiding him. Keep the atmosphere positive and supportive. In time, you'll likely find he is fully daytime potty trained and even initiating on his own when he needs to go.

Lastly, remember to **be kind to yourselves** as parents and caregivers. This journey can be intense, so support each other and take breaks as needed. Reach out to your pediatrician or an occupational therapist if you need further guidance -- they can offer tailored advice or reassure you on typical vs. atypical issues. Given your child's strengths (he's bright with letters/numbers and responds well to music), you've incorporated those into training, which is wonderful. Continue to use his interests to keep him engaged. And don't forget to **acknowledge his successes** verbally often -- let him know you notice his progress: "You're doing so well with the potty, we're proud of you!" That pride will also glow in him as he masters this new skill.

With consistency, patience, and love, you are setting your toddler up for potty training success. Good luck, and happy potty training! 🎉🚽
