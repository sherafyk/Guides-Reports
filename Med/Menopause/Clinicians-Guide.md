# Chapter 1: Menopause



## Menopause Demographics, Staging, and Terminology

very woman who survives the middle-age stage of life will experience menopause, usually when aged between 40 and 58 years. Worldwide, popula-tions are projected to age over the coming decades, with the number of women aged 50 years and older

expected to grow significantly. In 1990, 471 million women worldwide were aged at least 50 years. In 2015, this number increased by 82.6% worldwide (861 million in 2015), which corresponds to a 2.4% increase per year on average.1

By the year 2020, the number of US women who will be aged at least 50 years is estimated to be 64 million.2 This number is expected to increase to close to 90 mil-lion by 2060. The overall life expectancy for US females is 81.2 years, which has been unchanged since 2012.3 The probability of survival from age 50 to 80 years in US women was estimated to be 67.2% in 2013; US women who survive to age 50 are expected to live an average of

33.3 more years.4 With increasing life expectancy, many women will spend up to 40% of their lives in postmeno-pause, with more than 60% surviving at least until the age of 80 years.

Similarly, more Canadian women will experience meno-pause over the coming decades. In 2016, about 39% of Canadian women were aged at least 50 years. This number is projected to increase to 43% in 2038; assuming medium growth rate.5,6 With the remarkable increase in life expec-tancy at birth of 23.0 years for Canadian women (from 60.6 y in 1920-1922 to 83.6 y in 2009-2011), many Canadian women also will spend up to 40% of their lives postmenopause.7

### Staging

Menopause marks an important stage in a woman’s life, characterized by changes in bleeding patterns, hormone

levels, body composition, and psychosocial well-being. A standard reproductive staging system and universally accepted menopause terminology are critical to advanc-ing clinicians’ and researchers’ understanding of this inevitable event.

In 2001, the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) established basic terminology and a staging system to characterize the last 10 to 15 years of a wom-an’s reproductive aging.8 STRAW was refined in 2011 to include data-driven adjustments to the original staging system (STRAW+10).9

STRAW+10 is now considered to be the gold standard for characterizing reproductive aging, from the reproductive years through menopause. It divides the reproductive-aging continuum into seven stages—five before and two after the final menstrual period ().9

### Terminology

**Climacteric.**** **The term *climacteric** *has been defined as the period of endocrinologic, somatic, and transitory psychologic changes that occur at the time of meno-pause. The term is sometimes used interchangeably with *perimenopause*.

**Early**** ****menopause**** ****and**** ****late**** ****menopause. ***Early menopause *and *late** **menopause** *are vague terms that can be used to describe menopause that occurs earlier or later within the normal range of ages at the final menstrual period (FMP). Menopause is usually considered early when the FMP occurs before age 45 and late when it occurs after age 54.

##### Early postmenopause and late postmenopause. STRAW

+10 classified postmenopausal women as in *early** **post-**menopause *if they are within 8 years of their FMP; otherwise, they are classified as in *late postmeno-pause*. Unlike early postmenopausal women, late

1

postmenopausal women experience more limited or no further changes in reproductive endocrine function but greater effects of the somatic aging process.

**Induced**** ****menopause. ***Induced** **menopause** *is defined as the cessation of menses that comes after either surgical removal of both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy, with or without hysterectomy) or iatrogenic ablation of ovar-ian function (by chemotherapy, pelvic radiation, or other forms of ovarian toxicity). Bilateral oophorectomy is the most common cause of induced menopause.

**Menopause**** ****transition.**** **According to STRAW+10, the *menopause** **transition** *is defined as the time before the FMP when the menstrual cycle becomes variable or other menopause-related symptoms begin. Based on the degree of variability of the menstrual cycle, women could be classified as being in the early (7 or more days

persistent difference in cycle lengths from previous normal cycle) or late (60 or more days of amenorrhea, observed at least one time) transition stages.

**Natural**** ****menopause. ***Natural menopause *is defined as the permanent cessation of menses because of loss of ovarian follicular activity. Occurrence of natural menopause can only be determined retrospectively after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea after the FMP. For some women, menstrual-bleeding criteria cannot be used to define menopause, and the diagnosis can be supported with crite-ria including history of bilateral oophorectomy, symptoms, or measurement of endocrine markers.

**Perimenopause. **The term *perimenopause *literally means “around menopause.” It begins with the onset of intermenstrual cycle irregularities (±7 d) or other meno-pause-related symptoms and extends beyond the FMP to

include the 12 months after menopause, thus lasting 1 year longer than the menopause transition. Perimenopause is a clinically useful term because it encompasses the highly symptomatic years.

**Postmenopause.**** **The term *postmenopause** *refers to the stage of life after menopause.

**Premature menopause/Premature ovarian failure/ Primary**** ****ovarian**** ****insufficiency. **These terms all refer to menopause that occurs before age 40. Because prema-ture cessation of ovarian function may not always be permanent and because of the negative implication of the term “failure,” *primary** **ovarian** **insufficiency** *(POI) has emerged as the preferred terminology.10 Several studies, including the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), indicate that the percentage of US women experiencing POI is approximately 1%. Applying this 1% estimate to the projected number of US women who will be aged 15 to 44 years in 2020 (approximately 65 million), approximately 650,000 US women will experience POI. This number will increase to almost 730,000 women by 2060.2 It has been recommended by The North American Menopause Society and the Ameri-can Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that the term premature ovarian failure no longer be used.

**Premenopause. **The term *premenopause *refers to the stage of life that precedes menopause.

As women traverse the menopause, several physical and psychological alterations happen. Women and their healthcare providers may be challenged to distinguish menopause-related changes from those attributable to normal aging. A number of endocrine systems manifest age-related changes that may or may not have their onset during the menopause transition. Furthermore, concur-rent medical disorders such as obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, thyroid disease, and hypertension often develop during midlife and may influence repro-ductive aging.

## Stages of Reproductive Aging

Aging is a natural, time-related, genetically determined and environmentally modified process of deterioration of the physiological functions.

Women are born with a finite number of oocytes that decline over a woman’s lifetime. The ovaries of a female fetus contain 6 to 7 million oocytes at approximately

20 weeks’ gestation, 1 to 2 million at birth, and 300,000 to 500,000 at the onset of puberty. About 400 to 500 oocytes will be ovulated, but most oocytes are lost through apoptosis.11 Loss of oocytes from ovulation and atresia characterize reproductive aging.

Although menopause is ultimately defined by ovarian follicular exhaustion, several observations suggest that abnormal estradiol-positive feedback mechanisms and an attenuated luteinizing hormone (LH) surge contribute to reproductive aging, independent of ovarian failure.12,13 The wide range of age at which menopause occurs (40-58 y) indicates that chronologic age is not a useful predictor of reproductive senescence. Despite improvements in overall longevity, reproductive senescence occurs earlier than failure of other organ systems.12

To provide nomenclature and encourage consistency in research and reporting, a standardized definition of reproductive aging based on menstrual-cycle bleeding criteria and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels was initially proposed by STRAW in 2001 and was sub-sequently validated.8,14-16 In 2011, the multidisciplinary, multinational, STRAW+10 workshop reevaluated the cri-teria for the staging system and incorporated new data related to FSH, antral follicle count (AFC), antimülle-rian hormone (AMH), and inhibin B, as well as evidence regarding postmenopause changes in FSH and estradiol levels.9 Data from several cohort studies on midlife women (SWAN, the Tremin Research Program on Women’s Health, the Melbourne Women’s Midlife Health Project, the Seattle Midlife Women’s Health Study, the Michigan Bone Health and Metabolic Study, the Biodemographic Models of Reproductive Aging, and the Penn Ovarian Aging Study) were analyzed and adopted by consensus. Menstrual-cycle criteria remain the most important stag-ing criteria.

STRAW+10 staging is applicable to women regardless of demographics, age, body mass index (BMI), and life-style characteristics. Special considerations apply to some clinical situations. The course of reproductive aging in women with POI compared with that of healthy women appears to be more variable, including potential episodes of resumption of menstrual cycles.17

Menstrual-cycle criteria cannot be applied to women who do not have regular menstrual cycles. Menstrual-bleeding criteria also cannot be used in staging women after hysterectomy or endometrial ablation; therefore, reproductive aging can be assessed using endocrine mark-ers. However, endocrine evaluation is not recommended for at least 3 months after surgery, given the fact that FSH levels may be transiently elevated after pelvic surgery.18

The STRAW+10 writing group acknowledged particular challenges in evaluating reproductive aging in women with chronic illnesses and those undergoing chemotherapy.9

The STRAW+10 staging system has seven stages, each with specific clinical criteria, endocrine parameters, and characteristic markers of reproductive aging. Five stages precede and two come after the final menstrual period. Stages −5 to −3 comprise the reproductive interval; −2 to

−1, the menopause transition; and +1 to +2, postmenopause (Fi).9 It must be emphasized that not all healthy women follow this pattern. Most women progress from one stage to the next; however, there are women who can move back and forth between stages or skip a stage.

### Reproductive stages

**(STRAW+10**** ****stages**** ****−5,**** ****−4,**** ****−3b,**** ****and**** ****−3a)**

The reproductive phase includes three stages: early (stage

−5), peak (stage −4), and late (stages −3b and −3a).9 Men-arche is considered as entry into stage −5. It usually takes several years to assume regular menstrual cycles, which should then occur every 21 to 35 days for a number of years and is a landmark of stages −4 and −3b.

The late reproductive stage (STRAW+10 stage −3) marks the time when fecundability begins to decline and a woman may begin to notice changes in her menstrual cycles.9 Critical endocrine changes relevant to fertility occur before changes in the menstrual cycle are noted. The late reproductive stage has been divided into two phases: −3b and −3a.

In −3b, the earlier phase, menstrual cycles and early follicular-phase FSH remain normal. However, AMH and AFC are low. Most studies suggest that inhibin B is also low.19-21

The late reproductive stage (stage −3a) is characterized by subtle menstrual-cycle changes in flow and length, with increasing frequency of shorter cycles, variable FSH levels, and other markers of ovarian aging being low.

### Endocrine and ultrasound evaluation

Cycle day 3 FSH is the most commonly used test of ovar-ian reserve.22 The increase in FSH contributes to the advancement of follicles leaving the resting phase. The estradiol level in the early follicular phase is either normal or elevated. Aromatase expression increases with age in regularly cycling women and compensates for the known age-related decrease in granulosa cell number in the dom-inant follicle.23 FSH should therefore be interpreted in conjunction with an estradiol level. Elevated estradiol can suppress FSH, giving “falsely” normal FSH levels.

Antimüllerian hormone is produced by the granu-losa cells of preantral and small antral follicles, many of which are unmeasured by ultrasound. Its most impor-tant clinical application is based on its ability to represent the number of preantral and antral follicles24 and predict the response to ovarian hyperstimulation25 or assess iatrogenic damage (radiation, chemotherapy, uterine artery embolization, and ovarian surgery) to ovarian follicle reserve.26 Antimüllerian hormone levels capture quantitative but not qualitative data on ovarian reserve. Age-dependent decline in oocyte quality may be related to various factors: deterioration of the integrity and func-tion of the meiotic spindle; impairment of the selection process, allowing poor-quality oocytes to develop to the dominant follicle; cumulative damage to the oocyte with age; and decreased quality of granulosa cells.27-29

Data on the relationship between AMH and natural fertility at different stages of reproductive life are limited. One large study demonstrated that AMH levels were not associated with fertility (time to pregnancy) in couples without a diagnosis of infertility attempting concep-tion.30 Thus, ovarian reserve testing is not recommended as a screening tool to predict infertility in the general population.

Information about AMH levels across the female repro-ductive lifespan comes primarily from aggregate data from several studies.31-33 One model shows that the peak AMH concentration is observed at 24.5 years, with a strong cor-relation between AMH and the number of follicles from the time of the peak levels until menopause.32 However, from birth to the time of peak AMH, lower levels may not correlate with follicle numbers. Thus, caution is recom-mended in interpreting AMH levels in girls and in women aged younger than 25 years.34

There is high interindividual variability in AMH sec-ondary to the significant differences in the number of small follicles. Most studies demonstrate relatively stable AMH throughout the menstrual cycle; however, some studies suggest that intracycle variability may be some-what greater in younger women with high levels compared with older women with lower levels.35

Antimüllerian hormone levels also may be influenced by exogenous hormone use. This should be taken into con-sideration when interpreting values in the clinical setting. As demonstrated in several studies, AMH levels can be 29.8% to 50% lower in hormone contraception users and can increase after discontinuation.36-40 Similarly, lower AMH levels also have been observed during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters.41

Available data are conflicting in terms of the relation-ship between AMH, BMI, and smoking.42 Some ethnic variations have been observed, with white women having higher AMH levels than black and Hispanic women.

Antral follicle count, as defined by the number of ultra-sound-detectable follicles 2 mm to 10 mm, and AMH are both useful markers of ovarian response to controlled ovarian stimulation.43 Antral follicles are sensitive to FSH. They correlate with the number of primordial follicles and are considered to represent the available pool of follicles. Despite the strong correlation between AFC and AMH, they provide complementary information and should not be interpreted interchangeably. Antral follicle count demonstrates the number of viable follicles, which are potentially losing ability to produce AMH but will respond to the gonadotropins and the cohort of nonvi-able atretic follicles, whereas AMH provides information on very small, partially unmeasured by ultrasound, and

nonatretic follicles.43,44

**Menopause transition ****(STRAW+10**** ****stages**** ****−2**** ****and**** ****−1)**

The menopause transition is characterized by menstrual cycle irregularity, reflecting an increase in variability of hormone secretion and inconsistent ovulation.45 The tran-sition culminates with menopause, the complete cessation of menses. There is no specific endocrine marker of the early or late transition.46

***Early menopause transition (stage −2) ***Consistent with the original STRAW classification and the ReSTAGE Collaboration,8,15,16 the formal onset of the early menopause transition as defined in STRAW+10 is marked by a persistent difference of 7 days or more in the length of consecutive cycles.9 Persistence is defined as recurrence within 10 cycles of the first variable-length cycle. Cycles in the early menopause transition are also characterized by elevated but variable early follicular-phase FSH levels and low AMH levels and AFC.

***Late menopause transition (stage −1) ***According to STRAW+10 and consistent with the original STRAW and ReSTAGE criteria for the late menopaus tran-sition is 60 or more consecutive days of amenorrhea.9 One such episode is sufficient to stage women aged 45 years and older. For women aged 40 to 44 years, recurrence of an episode of amenorrhea of 60 days or longer within a year improves prediction of entry into the late meno-pause transition. Menstrual cycles are characterized by

increased variability in cycle length, extreme fluctuations in hormone levels, and increased prevalence of anovula-tion. FSH levels fluctuate between postmenopause and those consistent with the reproductive stages. A serum FSH level of 25 IU/L or higher in a random blood draw has been incorporated into the STRAW+10 classification criteria as an independent marker for the late menopause transition. This stage is estimated to last, on average, 1 to 3 years.

#### Clinical implications

An explanation for elevated serum estradiol levels during some cycles in the menopause transition reflects a physi-ologic phenomenon termed *luteal** **out-of-phase** *(LOOP) event ().22,47 In a LOOP cycle, which occurs in about one in four cycles in women studied during the early menopause transition (and approximately one-third of women in the late menopause transition), elevated FSH levels are adequate to recruit a second follicle during the luteal phase of an ongoing cycle.22 Recruitment of a second follicle results in a follicular phase-like rise in estradiol secretion superimposed on the mid- to late-luteal phase of the ongoing ovulatory cycle. FSH levels drop to midrepro-ductive levels during the menstrual and follicular phases of the subsequent cycle, and estradiol levels peak dur-ing the subsequent menstrual phase. Concurrent with persistent estradiol elevations are marked falls in luteal progesterone. About half the time, an LH surge and ovula-tion occur within the first 5 days of the cycle. As a result, the final length of the second cycle is unusually short (<21 d). If ovulation does not occur, estradiol levels drop until the onset of a new follicular phase, and the resulting cycle is then longer than average (>36 d).

Overproduction of estradiol by an enlarged cohort of recruited follicles or a LOOP cycle may result in mastalgia, migraine, menorrhagia, growth of uterine fibroids, or endometrial hyperplasia. Conversion of androgen to estro-gen through aromatization increases with age and body weight, another mechanism resulting in elevated estradiol levels during the menopause transition.48 Women with a longer menopause transition might experience increased exposure to unopposed estrogen and an increased risk for reproductive cancers.49

Despite the reduction in fertility with reproductive aging, women should be aware that pregnancy can occur until menopause, at least based on the hormone dynam-ics of the menstrual cycles that have been observed. In one study of the menopause transition, 25% of all cycles longer than 60 days were ovulatory.50 The average day of

ovulation occurred on day 27 of the cycle. In other studies, approximately 40% to 60% of cycles were anovulatory,45 but several oocytes may be released during other cycles, perhaps accounting for the increased incidence of twins born to midlife women. Evaluation of menstrual-cycle dynamics in women approaching menopause in SWAN indicated that an ovulatory pattern is present in most cycles up to the time of the FMP.51

As women progress through the menopause transi-tion, the number of anovulatory cycles increases.52 As anticipated, progesterone levels are low during anovula-tory cycles. Measures of overall progesterone secretion show a linear decline from STRAW+10 stages −3 to −1 and

+1.50,52 In other studies, progesterone levels are reduced late in the menopause transition or not reduced at all in ovulatory cycles.45,53

Estradiol levels also vary: in anovulatory cycles that ended in bleeding, estradiol levels are comparable with those of women who had ovulated. In cycles without bleeding, estradiol levels are low, approximately one-third

the level characteristic for ovulatory cycles. Women who are obese are more likely to have anovulatory cycles char-acterized by high estradiol levels.52,54 Women who are obese also are more likely to have lower premenopause yet higher postmenopause estradiol levels compared with women of normal weight.55,56

Women of different ethnic groups demonstrate simi-lar patterns of hormone changes with the menopause transition, but the concentration of hormones differs.57 Chinese and Japanese women have lower estradiol levels than white, black, and Hispanic women. FSH concentra-tions are higher in black women than in women of other ethnicities. The ethnic differences are independent of menopause status.

The longitudinal Melbourne Women’s Midlife Health Project that followed women through the menopause transition demonstrated that testosterone levels did not change over time.58 Other studies evaluating testosterone concentrations during the menopause transition present conflicting data.

In one small study, the midcycle rise of free testos-terone and androstenedione, characteristic of younger (19-37 y), regularly cycling women, was found to be consistently and significantly absent in older (43-47 y), regularly cycling women.59 Total testosterone levels and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) did not differ sig-nificantly in any cycle stage between older and younger women. Data from the Rancho Bernardo Study suggest that reduction in testosterone levels at menopause may be transient and followed by normalization in older women.60 In a large cross-sectional Australian study, serum andro-gen levels were shown to decline with age from the early reproductive years without changing at the menopause transition.61 As in the Rancho Bernardo study, testosterone levels increased slightly during the seventh decade of life. In the Melbourne Women’s Midlife Health Project, the menopause transition was associated with a drop in the levels of SHBG.58 During the 4 years before menopause to 2 years after menopause, SHBG levels decreased by approximately 40%. The greatest change occurred 2 years before menopause and was concurrent with a dramatic decline in serum estradiol. Reduced SHBG levels alter the free androgen index, calculated as the ratio of testoster-one to SHBG. The index rises by nearly 80% during the menopause transition, with the maximal change occur-

ring 2 years before the FMP.

### Postmenopause

**(STRAW+10**** ****stages**** ****+1a,**** ****+1b,**** ****+1c,**** ****and**** ****+2)**

The hallmark for initiation of postmenopause is the FMP. There is no single specific endocrine marker of postmenopause.46

***Early****** ******postmenopause ******(stages****** ******+1a,****** ******+1b,****** ******and****** ******+1c)***

During the first 2 years of early postmenopause, FSH con-tinues to rise and estradiol continues to decrease.9 STRAW stage +1a is defined as the 12 months after the FMP, which is also defined as the end of perimenopause. Stage +1b encompasses the second postmenopause year and ends at the time point at which FSH and estradiol levels begin to stabilize. Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are most likely to occur during stages +1a and +1b, which in general last 2 years. During the 3- to 6-year period defined as stage

+1c, high FSH levels and low estradiol levels stabilize.

***Late****** ******postmenopause****** ******(stage****** ******+2)***

Stage +2 begins 5 to 8 years after the FMP and continues for the remaining lifespan.9 Further changes in reproduc-tive endocrine function are limited, and somatic aging

predominates. This phase is marked by increasing genito-urinary symptoms; however, some studies demonstrated decreases in FSH level in more elderly women.

Endocrine findings during postmenopause include elevated FSH and LH, with FSH levels consistently greater than 20 mIU/mL starting approximately 4 years after menopause. Postmenopause estradiol levels range from 10 pg/mL to 25 pg/mL, and estrone levels average 30 pg/mL but may be higher in women who are obese because aromatization increases in proportion to adipose tissue volume.62

Transient elevations of estradiol in postmenopausal women may reflect activity in a residual follicle, but such activity does not usually result in ovulation. At least one such case, however, has been formally reported,63 and many clinicians can attest to at least one woman who has described a “normal” menstrual cycle accompanied by premenstrual molimina and normal pattern of menstrual bleeding after menopause. These episodes, nevertheless, constitute unscheduled postmenopausal bleeding and as such must be formally evaluated.

The postmenopausal ovary continues to produce andro-stenedione and testosterone. Higher levels of androgens in some postmenopausal women might reflect ovarian stromal hyperplasia and luteinization.64

In the Rancho Bernardo Study, women aged 50 to 89 years with intact ovaries had total testosterone levels that increased with age, reaching premenopause levels by age 70, with relatively stable levels thereafter.60 In a report from the Cardiovascular Health Study, total testos-terone levels declined with age until age 80, whereas free testosterone levels did not vary by age.65 White ethnicity, lower BMI, oral estrogen, and corticosteroid use were each associated with lower testosterone levels in women aged older than 65 years.

Surgical menopause results in lower testosterone levels. In the Rancho Bernardo study, women who had under-gone bilateral oophorectomy with hysterectomy had testosterone levels that did not vary with age and were 40% to 50% lower than levels in women with an intact uterus and ovaries.60

## Physiology of the Menopause Transition

The hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis undergoes a series of changes as a woman traverses menopause. The primary driver of change is ovarian follicular depletion, which begins even before birth and results in a progressive, exponential loss of follicles over a woman’s lifetime.11,66 Follicle dysfunction precedes the

near-complete exhaustion that occurs at menopause, and several patterns of change have been described along with an overall progression.

### The normal menstrual cycle in midreproductive life

An idealized menstrual cycle is 28 days long, with a fol-licular phase that lasts for 14 days and a luteal phase that also lasts for 14 days (). Early follicular-phase FSH levels rise slightly, which i nitiates a wave of follicu-logenesis. As a dominant follicle is selected, estradiol rises exponentially until the midcycle peak (day 13). This peak in estradiol initiates an LH, and to a lesser extent, FSH surge on day 14. The LH surge completes the process of ovulation and corpus luteum formation, and progester-one production rises dramatically over the course of the luteal phase, peaking at about days 20 to 22 and declin-ing thereafter in the absence of a pregnancy. All of these cardinal hormone events are affected by the changes of the menopause transition.

***The****** ******early****** ******transition****** ******(STRAW+10****** ******stage****** ******−2) ***The early transition may be best conceptualized as a state of “compensated failure” of the HPO axis. The decrease

in follicle numbers and size of the follicle cohort results in a reduction in circulating inhibin B and AMH, both of which are granulosa cell products and both of which help to restrain follicle growth.67 In early reproductive life, higher levels of AMH and inhibin B help protect the entire follicle pool in the ovary and limit the number of follicles in the “growing pool” each month, preventing a woman from ovulating all of her ovarian follicles over just a few menstrual cycles.68 With aging, the loss of inhibin B releases FSH from inhibitory restraint, allowing growth of the remaining, diminished follicle pool.67 The loss of AMH also releases the primordial ovarian follicles from growth inhibition, a mechanism that has been shown in the mouse68 and implied in humans.69 Although these two changes in hormone secretion make more follicles avail-able for ovulation and maintain regular cyclicity, they do so at the cost of accelerated follicle atresia.66

The early menopause transition is characterized by an increase in cycle irregularity by 7 or more days or an occa-sional “skipped” menstrual period without amenorrhea of 60 days or more in duration.9 In this part of the transi-tion, women do not have consistently low estradiol levels, although some of the classic symptoms of menopause begin to increase in prevalence. FSH and follicular-phase

estradiol are intermittently elevated, and sometimes luteal phase estradiol can be elevated compared with normally cycling midreproductive-aged women.70 Menstrual-cycle length shortens because the follicular phase of the cycle becomes compressed.71 The process of follicle growth is accelerated,72 but follicles reach a smaller peak diameter than they do in midreproductive-aged women.73 Folliculo-genesis even appears to occur in the luteal phase preceding the subsequent cycle.22,74 The net result of these changes is that women spend more time in the luteal phase of the cycle, which can lead to more premenstrual symptoms and more frequent menstrual periods.

Additional phenomena include ovulatory failures. These can happen via two mechanisms. In one case, there can be follicle growth, estradiol secretion, and an LH surge but no corpus luteum formation.73 In the other, an LH surge fails to occur despite apparently normal estrogen production.75 The latter situation, failure to mount an LH surge in the face of adequate estrogen exposure, indicates that there is hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction that accompanies the menopause transition. The HPO axis may become less sensitive to estrogen as a woman ages, and this may con-tribute to the cycle irregularity of the menopause transition.

***The****** ******late****** ******transition****** ******(STRAW+10****** ******stage****** ******−1)***

By the late transition, follicular depletion drops below a critical threshold, and the compensatory mechanisms that kept menstrual cyclicity relatively regular during the early transition can no longer keep pace. The follicle cohort becomes critically low, and folliculogenesis is intermittent. The late transition is marked by amenorrhea of longer than 60 days, and estrogen deficiency symptoms become much more prevalent as women go for longer lengths of time without sufficient estradiol production. When follicular growth does occur, failure of robust ovulation is more likely, and progesterone production over the luteal phase decreases.52 Eventually, follicle numbers become so low that folliculogenesis cannot occur, and estradiol and pro-gesterone production essentially ceases. For the first year after the final menses, estrogen production appears to occur at variable levels, but no progesterone production is observed, and women remain amenorrheic.76

Laboratory testing to determine a woman’s menopause stage is fraught with potential pitfalls. FSH levels are noto-riously variable both from cycle to cycle and day to day across a menstrual cycle. Although a very high FSH level can help predict that a woman is likely to be menopausal, a normal or low FSH is not informative.67 Attention has turned to the use of AMH as a potentially superior marker of time to menopause.77 Some investigators have reported

that the change in AMH over time also may be helpful in predicting menopause78; however, this marker has not yet been demonstrated to correlate with the STRAW stages of reproductive aging and requires validation in further clini-cal studies before it can be recommended for clinical use. It is important to remember that these mechanisms apply only to women who have had relatively regular menstrual cycles throughout their reproductive lives.

Women with amenorrhea syndromes have been studied only minimally. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), for example, is present in 5% to 20% of women, depending on the exact definition used.79,80 There is evidence that the progression to menopause for these women, although it involves the same physiologic fundamentals, is later in life and can be preceded by an appearance of regular menstrual cycling—for the first time in their lives.81 These late reproductive-aged cycles can be fertile and may repre-sent a brief period of time in which a woman with PCOS “escapes” from the chronic suppression of follicle growth brought about by elevated AMH levels.

The life course of women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, which is present in 3% to 5% of the popula-tion, is virtually unstudied. However, with reproductive aging, despite reduced central neural gonadotropin-releasing hormone drive, FSH may still rise, and follicle growth could theoretically occur. The clinical point is that amenorrhea syndromes should not be assumed to be fixed and irreversible, because the reproductive background changes with time.

## Adrenal Physiology and Menopause

The adrenal gland is composed of two functionally and embryologically distinct parts known as the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla.82 The adrenal cortex produces three main types of hormones: glucocorticoids (cortisol and corticosterone), produced in the zona fasciculata; min-eralocorticoids (predominantly aldosterone), produced in the zona glomerulosa; and sex steroids (primarily androgens), produced in the zona reticularis. The adrenal medulla produces and secretes catecholamines (epineph-rine, norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent, dopamine) in response to stimulation by sympathetic neurons. Dehy-droepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and androstenedione, often referred to as adrenal androgens, are precursor hormones produced in the adrenal gland that are enzymatically converted to active androgens or estrogens in the peripheral tissues.

Aldosterone secretion from the zona glomerulosa is regulated by three main factors: 1) angiotensin II (as part

of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in which renin secreted in response to decreased renal arterial blood pressure from the renal juxtaglomerular cells con-verts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which in turn is converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme into angio-tensin II); 2) potassium concentration (direct effect); and

3) adrenocorticotropic hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary (to a lesser degree).82

Glucocorticoid secretion from the zona fasciculata is regulated primarily by adrenocorticotropic hormone secreted from the anterior pituitary, which in turn is stim-ulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

Corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion and result-ing adrenal glucocorticoid secretion are influenced by circadian rhythms as well as by stressors. Cortisol exerts negative inhibitory feedback on the secretion of both cor-ticotropin-releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Adrenal androgen secretion is regulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone.83

Most of serum cortisol circulates bound to cortisol bind-ing globulin. Oral estrogen increases cortisol-binding globulin and, as a result, total cortisol concentration, as does the marked increase in estrogen that occurs during pregnancy.84 Tamoxifen increases serum cortisol concen-tration by a similar mechanism.85 In contrast, transdermal estrogen, which does not increase cortisol-binding globu-lin, has minimal effect on serum cortisol concentration.84 Salivary cortisol concentration, which reflects the free rather than total serum cortisol concentration, is not influ-enced by estrogen use.

### Effect of aging on adrenal function

Numerous studies have demonstrated that circulating levels of DHEAS decrease with age in both men and women,58,61,86 beginning in the early to mid-twenties.61,86 In women participating in SWAN, cross-sectional analyses confirmed the well-established age-related fall in circu-lating DHEAS levels, although longitudinal analyses of women undergoing the menopause transition demon-strated a transient increase in circulating DHEAS levels in the late menopause transition ().87,88 The transient increase in DHEAS over the menopause transition also occurs in women who have undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), supporting an adrenal origin of this phenomenon.89 Whether this transient increase in DHEAS bears physiologic significance is unknown. Studies evaluat-ing changes in cortisol concentration over the menopause transition have been conflicting. Although an analysis of

the SWAN cohort showing a transient increase in DHEAS over the menopause transition did not show an accompa-nying change in cortisol concentration,88 a transient rise in urinary cortisol was observed in the late menopause transition in the Seattle Midlife Women’s Health Study.90 Studies examining the relationships between VMS and HPA axis activation have been conflicting. Although VMS have been positively associated with urinary cortisol,91 and night sweat “bother” has been associated with higher plasma cortisol levels,92 cortisol levels were not associated with VMS severity in perimenopausal and early post-menopausal women participating in the Seattle Midlife

Women’s Health Study.93,94

### Relationships between LH/HPA axis and adrenal steroids

It has long been known that the adrenal cortex has recep-tors for LH.95 Despite this knowledge, the role of LH and its receptor in modulating adrenal gland function has remained unclear. Several interactions between LH and adrenal steroid production in pathologic states have been demonstrated. There are several case reports of adrenal tumors that grew or first appeared during pregnancy and were demonstrated to be stimulated by human chorionic gonadotropin, which has homology with LH and binds to the same receptor. In some of the cases, the excess in adrenal steroids resolved at the end of pregnancy96 and recurred in subsequent pregnancies.97 A case report of a woman with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia showed that LH stimulated cortisol production and that suppression of LH with leuprolide also suppressed cortisol production.98 Whether LH and adrenal steroids are related in non-pathologic conditions has also been investigated. A study of postmenopausal women demonstrated that higher serum LH levels were correlated with higher urinary cortisol levels and lower urinary aldosterone levels.99 A positive relationship between LH levels up to 41 IU/L, but not higher, and serum cortisol was also demonstrated in a group of 112 postmenopausal woman.100 In addition, LH levels were reported to correlate with levels of DHEAS. These studies suggest that LH may play a role in modu-lating levels of adrenal steroids in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Details of this regulation require

further investigation.

### Exogenous DHEA therapy

Although it is well established that circulating levels of adrenal androgens decline with age, supplementation with exogenous DHEA is not recommended in the gen-eral population because of the lack of evidence for efficacy

coupled with the absence of data assuring long-term safety.101 Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels are also lower in women with both primary and secondary adre-nal insufficiency, because the adrenal glands represent the predominant source of DHEA and DHEAS produc-tion. Studies evaluating the efficacy of exogenous DHEA treatment in women with adrenal insufficiency, however, have produced conflicting results.102 Furthermore, the potential risks of treatment, including androgenic adverse effects, lack of strict regulation of quality and content of DHEA supplements, and the unknown long-term safety profile of treatment, need to be considered.

One small randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of women with adrenal insufficiency found that women randomized to DHEA treatment experienced improvements in well-being and sexuality,103 but other studies have reported conflicting results.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs exam-ining DHEA treatment effects in women with adrenal

insufficiency concluded that DHEA treatment led to small improvements in quality of life and depression but no significant benefits in terms of anxiety and sexual well-being.102 The authors therefore concluded that the available evidence does not support routine use of DHEA in women with adrenal insufficiency.

Similarly, a systematic review and meta-analysis of DHEA use in postmenopausal women with normal adre-nal function found no evidence of improvement in sexual symptoms, serum lipids, serum glucose, weight, or bone mineral density (BMD).104 Routine DHEA use in post-menopausal women is not recommended.105 Local vaginal therapy with DHEA has been proven to improve vaginal pain and dyspareunia.

### Adrenal fatigue

The term *adrenal fatigue** *has been promulgated by pop-ular media to describe a purported scenario in which chronic exposure to long-term physical, emotional, or

psychological stress leads to downregulation of the HPA axis and resulting fatigue of the adrenal glands.106,107 There is no diagnostic test for adrenal fatigue, although some practitioners employ salivary cortisol day curves using unsubstantiated reference ranges that can engender abnormal results in healthy people. Symptoms of adrenal fatigue, including fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and mood disturbances, are nonspecific and common to many medi-cal conditions as well as to everyday life.

Despite the permeation of this purported condition throughout the media and in health books, evidence of its existence is lacking to date. This unproven diagnosis must be distinguished from true adrenal insufficiency, a well-characterized medical condition resulting from hypofunction of the adrenal glands or pituitary gland that is diagnosed by low serum cortisol levels at baseline or in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation, for which glucocorticoid replacement therapy is essential. Known potential risks of glucocorticoid therapy include osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, myopathy, and psychiatric symptoms; in the absence of a proven medical condi-tion that warrants glucocorticoid therapy, the risks of therapy are not justified. Furthermore, it is well-known that long-term exogenous glucocorticoid therapy can cause adrenal insufficiency via suppression of the HPA axis. Ironically, this in turn prevents the adrenal glands from adequately responding to physical stress and can be life-threatening if unrecognized or undertreated. Another “cost” of diagnosis is distraction from the recog-nition and appropriate treatment of another underlying and potentially treatable condition, such as depression, obstructive sleep apnea, or another medical problem.

A 2016 systematic review concluded that most studies describing adrenal fatigue lacked quantitative assess-ment of adrenal function by accepted methodology and produced conflicting results.107 Based on the lack of sub-stantive evidence, the authors concluded that adrenal fatigue does not exist. The Endocrine Society has agreed with the conclusion that there is “no substantiation that ‘adrenal fatigue’ is an actual medical condition.”106

## Primary Ovarian Insufficiency and Early Menopause

Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a distinct clinical entity with multiple etiologies, characterized by hypergo-nadotrophic hypogonadism in women aged younger than 40 years (previously known as *premature ovarian failure*). The term POI is preferred to the term *premature** **ovarian*

*failure *because the condition is neither always complete ovarian failure nor always permanent.108

Primary ovarian insufficiency is thought to affect approximately 1% of US women by age 40, which is approx-imately two standard deviations below the median age at menopause.109,110 Early menopause occurs in approximately 3% of the population aged between 40 and 45 years.109 Pri-mary ovarian insufficiency also is present in approximately 1 in 1,000 women aged younger than 30 years and 1 in 10,000 women aged younger than 20 years.111

Despite episodes of amenorrhea and elevated FSH levels, ovulation in women with POI may occur inter-mittently and unpredictably for several years. It is estimated that 25% of women with POI will experience at least one spontaneous return of ovarian function.112 In women with POI who have a normal karyotype, one-half may still have ovarian follicles capable of functioning intermittently. A pregnancy rate of 5% to 10% has been reported in one systematic review.113 Other data suggest that spontaneous pregnancy rates are closer to 3% to 5%.112,114 In a large proportion of women diagnosed with spontaneous POI, the etiology behind the syndrome remains undiagnosed, and the term idiopathic POI is appropriate.110

### Early menopause

Early menopause is defined as menopause occurring between the ages of 40 and 45 years. It occurs natu-rally in 3% to 5% of the population, but more commonly early menopause is surgical.109,115 Although no specific diagnostic workup is necessary for women with early menopause, these women are also at increased risk for the long-term effects of early estrogen deficiency com-pared with women who experience menopause at the average age. Multiple medical societies, including The North American Menopause Society, the International Menopause Society, the American College of Obste-tricians and Gynecologists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the British Medical Society, and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, as well as the Endocrine Society, support the philosophy of the use of hormone therapy (HT) for women with POI and early menopause until the average age of menopause.116-118

**Etiologies**** ****of**** ****POI**** ****and**** ****early**** ****menopause**** **Primary ovarian insufficiency has multiple etiologies, including genetic (X-chromosome related and autosomal), autoimmune, toxic, infectious, metabolic, and iatrogenic

causes ().108,109,113,119-126 About a third of cases appear to be familial, with at least one affected female relative.127

#### Genetic

Genetic factors can affect gonadal development, DNA replication or meiosis and repair, hormone signaling, immune function, and metabolism.114 Women with primary amenorrhea will have a higher incidence of karyotypic abnormalities (21%) compared with women who present with secondary amenorrhea (11%).110,128,129 If a Y chromosome is found, gonadectomy is recommended because of the elevated risk of gonadoblastoma.130

**Turner**** ****syndrome. **Turner syndrome, the most common identifiable genetic disorder for POI, refers to the complete or partial loss of one X chromosome. It has been postulated to occur because of the reduction of X-linked genes that escape X inactivation or the lack of the matching X gene pair at meiosis.131 Other X chromosome abnormalities associated with POI include triple X, mosaics, deletions, isochromosomes, microdeletions, translocations, and point mutations. Rare single nucleotide variations in both X and autosomes have been discovered by new genetic tools and analysis of candidate genes in mice models of infertility.

Turner syndrome occurs in 1 in 2,500 to 3,000 births, although 99% of Turner syndrome fetuses are associated with miscarriage.132 Phenotypic expression includes—among others—POI, short stature, lymphedema (commonly webbed neck), cardiac (coarctation of the aorta, bicuspid aortic valve) and renal anomalies, endo-crine dysfunction, wide-spaced nipples and shield chest, cubitus valgus, short fourth metacarpal, and auditory or ophthalmologic problems.132,133 Women with complete monosomy X develop a normal complement of primordial follicles but undergo accelerated follicular atresia, usually resulting in prepubertal primary ovarian insufficiency. Women with Turner mosaicism, often because of point mutations, may have spontaneous menarche or may pres-ent at varying ages with POI.134

In women with clinical suspicion, primary amenor-rhea, or hypergonadotropic POI, a karyotype should be offered. On diagnosis, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended.135 In the case of delayed puberty, girls with Turner syndrome should be treated with estrogen replace-ment, beginning at age 12. The recommended treatment includes transdermal estradiol at gradually increasing doses over 2 years to a target dose of 100 µg of estradiol. On menarche, progestogen replacement is added.

The benefits of estrogen replacement include devel-opment of secondary sex characteristics and maximal bone density accrual.133,136,137 There is no role for delaying estrogen therapy (ET) to maximize height with growth hormone treatment; this approach has a deleterious effect on building maximal bone density.133,138 For young women with primary ovarian insufficiency, adequate calcium and vitamin D are recommended.110 Girls with Turner syndrome should continue to be monitored through adulthood for cardiovascular disease (CVD), fracture risk, impaired glucose tolerance, celiac disease, hypothyroid-ism, hepatic dysfunction, and dyslipidemia. Women with Turner syndrome have a higher incidence of not only type 2 DM and congenital heart problems but also coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and mortality because of cardiometabolic complications.139 It is recom-mended to continue estrogen-progestogen therapy until an appropriate age for menopause.133,137 Women should be evaluated and counseled about their own personal risks if contemplating pregnancy via egg donation.

**Fragile**** ****X**** ****syndrome.**** **Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked inherited cause of POI in premutation carriers because of a mutation of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene.140 The premutation is carried by 1 in 200 women.141 The syndrome accounts for about 11.5% of familial POI but only 3% of sporadic POI and therefore has become one of the most common known genetic causes.131 Normally, there are 5 to 45 copies of the CGG trinuclear repeat in the 5’ area region of chromosome X. When there are more than 200 repeats, the full syndrome of fragile X syndrome with mental disability and autism, more commonly in men, occurs.142 When there are 55 to 200 repeats, or a “premu-tation allele,” there is an approximately 20% chance of developing POI.143 There is also a 16% risk of developing ataxia as the woman ages.142 It is recommended that women with POI be screened for the fragile X premutation because of the implications for their offspring and families.108

#### Autosomal defects

Autosomal defects caused by mutations in various genes have been found to be associated with POI. These are rare causes of POI. The presence of other phenotypic abnormalities in association with POI should prompt referral to a genetic counselor for consideration of addi-tional genetic panels for investigation.

#### Autoimmune

Autoimmune oophoritis is a rare cause of POI, occurring in 4% of women with spontaneous POI and adrenal

antibodies.108 It also may occur in type 1 and type 2 polyglandular autoimmune failures. The development of autoimmune POI usually precedes adrenal failure, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, it is recommended that the presence of steroidal antibodies prompt referral for careful follow-up by an endocrinologist.

#### Toxic, infectious, and metabolic

Mumps has been the classic but rare example of an infec-tious disease associated with oophoritis and potentially POI. When a postpubertal girl develops mumps-related parotitis, oophoritis should be suspected when lower abdominal tenderness or ovarian pain occurs.144 HIV infections have been associated with a higher incidence of early menopause, either because of the infection or the use of antiretroviral medications.145 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons released into the environment by fossil fuel combustion or through tobacco smoke also have been identified as potential contributors to POI development.146 From the evaluation of a nationwide population study, the incidence of POI was found to be higher in women with PCOS.147 The apparent paradox of women with an excess of follicles experiencing an earlier-than-normal menopause is unexplained in this study; however, the incidence of hysterectomy may have been higher in women with PCOS.

#### Iatrogenic

Early menopause can be medically or surgically induced. Iatrogenic menopause occurs as a result of bilateral oopho-rectomies or oophorocystectomies or with gonadotoxic chemotherapy or radiation.

**Surgical**** ****menopause.**** **Women with surgical menopause experience an abrupt nonreversible drop in hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and androgens). One in eight US women will have their ovaries removed for benign reasons before natural menopause.148 Many oophorec-tomies occur at the time of hysterectomy and are done in women with normal ovaries. In women at high risk of breast and ovarian cancer, such as carriers of *BRCA1 *and *BRCA2 *gene mutations, early elective oophorectomy does offer a significant reduction in all-cause mortal-ity by age 70.149 Elective bilateral oophorectomies done at the time of benign hysterectomy in premenopausal women aged younger than 45 years has been shown to lead to numerous negative long-term outcomes, such as increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.41), coronary heart disease (HR, 1.26), and CVD (HR, 1.84) and worse bone health, menopause symptoms, and

mood symptoms.148 There was also a higher incidence of Parkinson disease and cognitive impairment.150 In cases for which elective oophorectomy is being considered, the benefits and risks must be carefully reviewed and dis-cussed with the woman. If elective bilateral oophorectomy is performed, ET may be considered until the average age of menopause to mitigate the negative health outcomes of early surgical menopause.

**Chemotherapy and radiation-induced menopause. **Eighty percent of childhood patients with cancer now survive, and it is estimated that 1 in 168 US women between the ages of 20 and 39 years will develop cancer yearly.151 Types of chemotherapy used in women with cancer have vari-able gonadotoxic effects, depending on the type, previous ovarian reserve, dosage, and the age of administration.152 Women who undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant for various hematologic disease and malignancy are at par-ticularly high risk for POI after induction with whole-body radiation and chemotherapy.153

### Diagnosis of POI and early menopause

The standard diagnostic criterion for menopause (12 mo with no menses) as applied to women aged 40 years and older does not apply to younger women. Unfortunately, there is no characteristic menstrual history preceding either POI or early menopause. Some women have typi-cal menopause symptoms, at least intermittently, whereas others do not. Another group of women who present for advice are women who have decreased ovarian reserve found during infertility evaluations.

The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology guidelines for POI recommend these diagnos-tic criteria: 1) the presence of menstrual disturbance such as oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea for at least 4 months, and 2) an elevated FSH level more than 25 IU/L on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart.110

Severe menopause symptoms often occur in women who experience induced menopause by oophorectomy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. Symptoms include hot flashes, mood changes, depression, insomnia, and a lack of energy. Some may experience joint pain or symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vaginal dry-ness, burning, painful intercourse). The timeframe of onset of symptoms to progression of early menopause is unpredictable. Because early estrogen deficiency has a negative effect on bone density and possibly on cogni-tive function and sexual function, repeated testing and a timely diagnosis is warranted.150,154-156 A careful history and physical examination are needed to rule out other

causes of menstrual dysfunction, particularly secondary amenorrhea ().108

_Abbreviations: DM, diabetes mellitus; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; POI, primary ovarian insufficiency; PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome._




Initial laboratory evaluation after a negative pregnancy test includes serum prolactin, FSH, estradiol, and thyroid-stimulating hormone and is warranted for any woman aged younger than 40 years who misses three or more consecutive menstrual cycles.157 Additional laboratory tests should be performed to exclude a variety of other causes ().

Transvaginal ultrasound imaging is useful to provide information regarding the ovarian volume and AFC.108 A karyotype and fragile X premutation testing is rec-ommended after the diagnosis of POI is made. The implications of chromosome abnormality or fragile X premutation should be discussed before the test is per-formed. Karyotype testing is helpful in diagnosing familial syndromes that include POI and identifying a Turner mosaic or translocation condition. Patients with positive adrenal antibodies should follow-up with an endocrinologist.

Whether HT is administered, baseline BMD testing is recommended and should be repeated every 5 years.108,110 In younger patients, attention should be given to the Z-score for their age and ethnic group rather than the T-score. Bisphosphonates (FDA pregnancy risk category C) should be avoided in young women, because many are hoping for conception. Animal studies with bisphospho-nates suggest teratogenicity, with consequences on fetal growth and skeletal development. In humans, preconcep-tion and first trimester use of bisphosphonates have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.158

First-degree relatives of women with POI should consider the increased risk of earlier menopause or fertility preser-vation measures when deciding when to have a family.110

**Management of POI and early menopause**** **Primary ovarian insufficiency is a devastating diagnosis for a young woman. Many women see multiple clinicians before the diagnosis is made, and many are unhappy with how the diagnosis was conveyed. Specialized multidisci-plinary clinics have been initiated to provide compassionate expert care for these women, with the goal of providing diagnosis, emotional support, general information, and encouragement about fertility options as well as to tailor individual prescriptions for optimal outcomes. Women diagnosed with POI should be counseled appropriately regarding the diagnosis, its etiologies, and the subsequent effects not only on fertility but also on long-term sequelae including longevity, quality of life, mood, cognition, bone health, cardiovascular health, and sexuality.

#### Hormone therapy

Physiologic estrogen and progestogen therapy mitigate the long-term effects of estrogen depravation on various organ systems and is considered standard of care for women with POI. Many women are reluctant to initiate HT because of the propagation of the dangers of HT after the publication of the results of the Women’s Health Initiative in 2002.159 However, HT for these young women is true “replacement therapy” and should be compared with the use of other steroid replacement therapies in other endocrine organs. These women will require long-term therapy that should be reevaluated yearly and possibly altered as the woman’s medical and social needs change.

#### Hormone therapy for secondary amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea

Because women with secondary amenorrhea and oligo-menorrhea are younger than typical menopausal women, many experts recommend treating with the equivalent

of the 100 µg transdermal estradiol patch, or 1.25 mg conjugated equine estrogens, or 2 mg of estradiol orally to approximate the average estrogen level produced in a reproductive-stage menstrual cycle (100 pm/L or 387 pml/L). If the uterus is present, a cyclical progestogen should be added for 12 days of the month.160 Note that at these higher doses of estrogen, additional progestin is needed to prevent hyperplasia.

If the woman does not want to risk becoming preg-nant in the situation of intermittent menses, hormone contraception can be used to provide hormone replace-ment.161-163 Emerging evidence, however, suggests that physiologic HT is superior to hormone contraceptives.163 Another option for women with heavier menses or intol-erance to progestins is an intrauterine progestin system combined with transdermal estrogen.164 An advantage of HT is that it is prescribed in a regimen of continu-ous ET, whereas in women taking the oral contraceptive pill, there can be a week-long hormone-free interval in therapy, amounting to 3 months of estrogen deficiency per year and possibly resulting in monthly symptoms of estrogen withdrawal during the hormone-free week.

Alternatives include the use of continuous or extended-cycle oral contraceptive pills. Therapies should be reviewed annually.110

For women experiencing an early menopause, especially if aged younger than 45 years, the benefits of using HT until the average age of natural menopause are believed to outweigh the risks. There is no evidence that HT increases the risk of breast cancer in this age group. In one popula-tion-based cohort of 1,003 women with POI, there was a decreased incidence of breast cancer (odds ratio, 0.59).165

### Ramifications of POI and early menopause

#### Life expectancy

Many of the studies about the ramifications of early menopause on life expectancy are accrued from obser-vational studies and large epidemiologic international databases of women with very long-term follow-ups. The Mayo Clinic Cohort Study of Oophorectomy and Aging166 and the Nurses’ Health Study (up to 28 y),167 as well as a 2016 large meta-analysis that included 23 studies,148 have confirmed earlier mortality, pri-marily because of CVD, in women who are rendered menopausal by surgery before the age of 45. This excess mortality from CVD is most pronounced for women who undergo oophorectomy and do not have subsequent ET.

Women experiencing early menopause or POI may experience significant psychological consequences.168 For some women, particularly those who are younger, the diagnosis can precipitate a range of emotions, includ-ing grief, sadness, and diminished self-esteem. In an older study of early menopausal women caused by BSO, anxiety and depression were significantly greater after BSO and reduced with estrogen use.169 Spontane-ous POI may be associated with an increased lifetime risk for major depression, as well as poorer psychoso-cial adjustment.170-171 Several studies show an increased risk of depression and anxiety in women with earlier menopause caused by BSO.172-173 One study did not show improvement with ET.172 Therefore, it is important to offer psychological support for concerns about early loss of fertility, self-image, and sexual function and be sen-sitive to mood changes in these women. Adequate HT to reduce menopause symptoms and possibly improve mood is suggested.

#### Fertility

Whenever possible, counseling regarding childbearing options should be provided before any chemotherapy, radi-ation, or surgery that may induce menopause. Clinicians

should consider referral to a fertility specialist in all situ-ations in which early loss of fertility is possible. Options for preserving fertility include ovarian hyperstimulation with oocyte retrieval followed by oocyte or embryo cryo-preservation, ovarian tissue cryopreservation, ovarian suppression with hormones, ovarian transposition, and conservative gynecologic surgery (eg, trachelectomy for cervical cancer). However, diminished ovarian reserve correlates with poor pregnancy rates with all these options, and not all options are available for all women.

Because of the possibility of spontaneous and unex-pected pregnancy, women with POI should be counseled early in their course of treatment regarding their desire to conceive. If pregnancy is not desired, oral contraceptives, barrier methods, or an intrauterine device are suggested to prevent the unlikely occurrence of an unintentional pregnancy. Oral contraceptives provide additional ben-efits, including relief of VMS and vaginal dryness and maintenance of BMD. A discussion of contraception is especially important for women who carry the FMR1 gene, who carry a higher risk for a child with mental retardation.
