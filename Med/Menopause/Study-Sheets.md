Study Sheet 1 -- **Menopause**
-----------------------------

*(Menopause demographics, staging & terminology, physiology, adrenal physiology, POI & early menopause)*

### Bird's-eye view

This chapter sets the foundation: what menopause is, when it happens globally, and how to **stage** reproductive aging using STRAW+10. It explains the terminology (perimenopause, postmenopause, early vs late menopause), the physiology of declining ovarian follicles and hormonal shifts, adrenal contributions, and how **primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)** and **early menopause** differ from normal timing.

Clinically, the big picture is: menopause is a **retrospective diagnosis** (12 months of amenorrhea), most women will spend ~40% of life postmenopause, and the STRAW+10 system is your common language for documenting stage, not just age.

### Must-know bullets

-   **Global aging & magnitude**: Number of women ≥50 is rising sharply; many will spend up to 40% of life postmenopause.

-   **US & Canada demographics**: US women ≥50 projected to grow from ~64 million (2020) to ~90 million by 2060; similar trends in Canada.

-   **Definition of natural menopause**: Permanent cessation of menses due to loss of ovarian follicular activity, confirmed after 12 months of amenorrhea.

-   **Induced menopause**: From bilateral oophorectomy or iatrogenic ovarian ablation (eg, chemo, pelvic radiation). Bilateral oophorectomy is the most common cause.

-   **Perimenopause**: "Around menopause" -- begins with intermenstrual irregularity or other menopause-related symptoms and extends beyond FMP into early postmenopause (first 12 months and sometimes up to 12 months after).

-   **STRAW+10 staging**: Standard reproductive staging system dividing reproductive aging into 7 stages (5 pre-FMP, 2 post-FMP); relies primarily on bleeding patterns and supported by FSH/AMH/AFC.

-   **Early vs late menopause**: "Early" when FMP <45 yrs; "late" when FMP >54 yrs (within otherwise normal range).

-   **Early vs late postmenopause**: Early if within 8 years of FMP; late postmenopause thereafter, with fewer endocrine changes but more somatic aging effects.

-   **POI vs early menopause**: POI = pathologic loss of ovarian function before age 40, often intermittent and variable; early menopause is FMP 40--44 within normal senescence spectrum.

-   **Oocyte decline**: ~6--7 million oocytes at 20 weeks' gestation → 1--2 million at birth → 300,000--500,000 at puberty → ~400--500 ovulated; the rest lost via atresia.

-   **Why age alone isn't enough**: Wide age range at menopause (40--58) means chronological age is a poor predictor of reproductive senescence.

### If you remember only 3 things from Chapter 1

1.  **Menopause is a retrospective clinical diagnosis**---12 months of amenorrhea after the FMP, not a single lab value.

2.  **STRAW+10 is the shared language** for staging reproductive aging using bleeding patterns ± hormonal markers.

3.  **POI (<40), early menopause (40--44), and induced menopause** all carry extra long-term health implications and need proactive management.

Study Sheet 2 -- **Midlife and Aging-Related Body Changes**
----------------------------------------------------------

*(Vulvovaginal changes, body weight, skin, hair)*

### Bird's-eye view

This chapter zooms out from strictly "ovarian" to **whole-body changes** around midlife: vulvovaginal tissues, weight and fat distribution, skin, and hair. It highlights how much of what patients blame on "hormones" is actually a mix of normal aging, lifestyle, and endocrine changes. The clinical trick is distinguishing what's benign and expected vs what signals disease or needs targeted intervention.

### Must-know bullets

-   **Chapter layout**: Four big topics---vulvovaginal changes, body weight, skin changes, hair changes---each with midlife/menopause focus.

-   **Vulvovaginal anatomy is hormone-sensitive**: Stratified squamous epithelium and connective tissue are estrogen- and DHEA-dependent, which explains atrophy and GSM later.

-   **Menopause vs aging**: Many physical and psychological changes occur as women traverse menopause; clinicians must tease out what's aging vs menopausal transition.

-   **Body weight**: Menopause is associated with increased abdominal and visceral fat and reduced lean mass, independent of age. Weight gain is more strongly related to aging and lifestyle than to HT itself.

-   **Visceral fat matters**: Shift from subcutaneous to visceral fat has metabolic consequences (blood pressure, lipids, insulin resistance).

-   **Skin & hair**: Estrogen and age-related changes alter collagen, elasticity, sebaceous activity, and hair cycling patterns---leading to dryness, wrinkling, and pattern hair loss in some women. (Overview from chapter structure.)

-   **Communication point**: Many "menopause" concerns are actually **midlife health maintenance issues** (weight, skin, hair) that respond better to lifestyle, dermatology, and general medical care than to HT.

### If you remember only 3 things from Chapter 2

1.  Midlife changes are **multi-factorial**: aging, lifestyle, and menopause all intersect---don't blame or treat everything as "hormones."

2.  Weight gain is mostly about **age + habits**, but menopause **redistributes** fat centrally with cardiometabolic consequences.

3.  Vulvovaginal tissues are estrogen-sensitive → sets the stage for GSM and later genitourinary complaints.

Study Sheet 3 -- **Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS)**
--------------------------------------------

*(Prevalence, etiology, treatment)*

### Bird's-eye view

This chapter covers hot flashes and night sweats: how common they are, what they do to quality of life, their possible mechanisms, and treatment options (hormonal and nonhormonal). VMS are linked not just to discomfort, but to **sleep, mood, cognition, and potentially CVD and bone health**.

### Must-know bullets

-   **Prevalence & impact**: VMS affect a large proportion of midlife women and are strongly linked with impaired sleep, depressed mood, and cognitive complaints.

-   **Health associations**: Meta-analyses show women with VMS have a more adverse CVD risk profile (higher BP, worse lipids, more insulin resistance) and links to lower BMD and even fractures.

-   **Risk factors**: High BMI, smoking, hysterectomy/oophorectomy, and some dietary patterns (high-fat/high-sugar vs Mediterranean-style) influence VMS risk and severity.

-   **Estradiol changes**: Declining ovarian estradiol is central, but not the whole story---VMS likely reflect multiple physiologic processes; correlation with estradiol levels is modest.

-   **Sleep link**: VMS are consistently associated with difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, and early awakening; sleep disturbance may mediate mood effects.

-   **First-line treatment: HT**: Estrogen alone or with progestogen reduces VMS frequency by ~75% and decreases severity; EPT or CEE/bazedoxifene needed if uterus present.

-   **Progestogen-only**: Can help VMS, but long-term safety data are limited; oral micronized progesterone 300 mg daily has RCT support for efficacy.

-   **Nonhormonal option -- paroxetine**: Low-dose paroxetine (7.5--25 mg) is the only FDA-approved nonhormonal VMS therapy; improves VMS and VMS-related sleep problems and is generally well tolerated.

-   **Other nonhormonal agents**: The chapter also reviews other SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, etc., but paroxetine has the strongest regulatory foothold.

### If you remember only 3 things from Chapter 3

1.  VMS are **not just annoying**---they're linked with sleep disturbance, mood, and possible CVD and bone risk.

2.  **HT is first-line and highly effective** for VMS when not contraindicated.

3.  **Paroxetine** is the main FDA-approved nonhormonal option, especially useful when HT is not appropriate.

Study Sheet 4 -- **Common Genitourinary Symptoms in Midlife Women**
------------------------------------------------------------------

*(GSM, other vulvar/vaginal disorders, lower urinary tract & pelvic floor)*

### Bird's-eye view

This chapter is all about the **genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)** and other vulvovaginal and lower urinary tract disorders that cluster in midlife: dryness, irritation, dyspareunia, recurrent UTIs, incontinence, pelvic floor dysfunction. It emphasizes careful history, targeted exam, and differentiating GSM from dermatoses, infection, and pain syndromes.

### Must-know bullets

-   **Definition of GSM**: Collection of signs and symptoms related to estrogen deficiency involving labia, introitus, vagina, clitoris, bladder, urethra; includes genital, urinary, and sexual symptoms. Diagnosis requires **bothersome** symptoms not explained by another condition.

-   **GSM symptoms**: Genital dryness, irritation, burning; urinary dysuria, urgency, recurrent UTIs; sexual dryness and pain.

-   **Assessment**: Detailed medical + sexual history, timing relative to menopause, OTC and prescription use, relationship context, and potential history of abuse all matter.

-   **Exam**: Inspect external genitalia, introitus, perineum; look for plaques, skin thickening, color changes, architectural loss, fissures, masses. Check for atrophy (pallor, friability, petechiae, loss of rugae).

-   **Investigations**: Vaginal pH, wet prep, cultures when indicated; bimanual exam to check tenderness, nodularity, masses; biopsy suspicious vulvar lesions.

-   **Other vulvar/vaginal conditions**: Vulvodynia classification (localized/generalized, provoked/spontaneous, etc.) and its management with topical/oral meds, pelvic floor PT, CBT, etc.

-   **Urinary incontinence subtypes**: Stress, urgency (OAB), mixed, extraurethral; midlife prevalence high but care-seeking low due to embarrassment and misconceptions.

-   **Evaluation of urinary symptoms**: Use symptom questions, urinary diaries (3 days), targeted physical exam, and consider pelvic floor disorders and falls risk.

-   **Nonpharmacologic UTI prevention**: Voiding after intercourse, front-to-back wiping, avoiding irritating soaps/perfumed products, cranberry extract/juice for recurrence reduction in some women.

### If you remember only 3 things from Chapter 4

1.  **GSM = estrogen deficiency + bothersome genital/urinary/sexual symptoms**, after ruling out other diagnoses.

2.  A **good history + vulvovaginal exam (with pH/wet prep)** is essential; don't assume "just atrophy."

3.  Urinary incontinence is common, under-reported, and **treatable**; basic evaluation and conservative measures go a long way.

Study Sheet 5 -- **Other Common Symptoms in Midlife Women**
----------------------------------------------------------

*(Fertility decline, sexual function, pelvic floor, AUB, memory, sleep, headache, arthralgia, IPV)*

### Bird's-eye view

This is the "symptoms grab-bag" chapter: it covers the many issues women bring up in midlife visits, from declining fertility and sexual function to pelvic floor complaints, abnormal uterine bleeding, memory concerns, sleep disturbance, headaches, joint pain, and intimate partner violence (IPV). The key is **pattern recognition**: when is this menopause-related, when is it something else, and when is it an emergency/red flag?

### Must-know bullets

-   **Chapter scope**: Decline in fertility, sexual dysfunction, pelvic floor function, abnormal uterine bleeding, memory impairment, sleep disturbance, headache, arthralgia, intimate partner violence.

-   **Sleep disturbance**: Insomnia disorder = ≥3×/week for ≥3 months with distress/impairment. Peri- and postmenopausal women report short sleep, poor quality, and more difficulty initiating/maintaining sleep.

-   **VMS--sleep--mood loop**: VMS strongly associated with sleep problems; sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms are tightly linked and often bidirectional.

-   **Memory & cognition**: Many women worry about cognitive decline; mood, sleep, and VMS often contribute more than neurodegeneration in this age band. (From chapter overview + SWAN references.)

-   **Headache**: Migraine patterns can change with fluctuating hormones; some women see perimenopausal worsening. Acute and preventive management must consider vascular risk.

-   **Arthralgia**: Joint pains are common; they overlap with arthritis (Chapter 6), weight, physical activity, and sometimes HT withdrawal.

-   **IPV**: Intimate partner violence is explicitly covered; clinicians are urged to screen and use system-based approaches to improve identification and support.

### If you remember only 3 things from Chapter 5

1.  Midlife symptoms often **cluster** (VMS + sleep + mood + pain + cognitive complaints); think in systems, not silos.

2.  Always check for **red flags** in abnormal uterine bleeding, headache, and joint pain---don't over-attribute to menopause.

3.  **IPV screening is part of menopause care**---it's in this chapter for a reason.

Study Sheet 6 -- **Diseases Common in Midlife Women**
----------------------------------------------------

*(Arthritis, depression, thyroid disease, gallbladder disease, STIs)*

### Bird's-eye view

Here the focus shifts to **co-morbid conditions** that frequently appear or worsen around the menopause transition: musculoskeletal disease, mood disorders, thyroid disease, biliary disease, and sexually transmitted infections. These conditions often **mimic or amplify menopause symptoms**, making differential diagnosis critical.

### Must-know bullets

-   **Chapter structure**: Arthritis, depression, thyroid disease, gallbladder disease, STIs.

-   **Arthritis burden**: Musculoskeletal disorders are a leading cause of years lived with disability; arthritis is more common with age and in women, so it often coexists with menopause.

-   **Symptom overlap**: Joint pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, mood symptoms can stem from arthritis/depression/thyroid disease and be misattributed to menopause alone.

-   **Depression & menopause**: Multiple studies show windows of vulnerability around the transition; depressive symptoms increase and are associated with VMS and sleep disturbance.

-   **Thyroid disease prevalence**: About 1 in 10 midlife women in SWAN had abnormal TSH; thyroid antibodies rise with age. Hypothyroidism is ~7× more common in women.

-   **Thyroid symptoms mimic menopause**: Menstrual changes, sleep disruption, fatigue, mood swings, forgetfulness, heat intolerance can all be thyroid-related.

-   **Thyroid screening**: Multiple organizations give differing recommendations; ATA suggests screening all adults from 35 q5yrs; others recommend targeted screening in older women or those with suspicious symptoms.

-   **STIs in older women**: Despite age, sexual activity and STI risk persist; providers are urged not to neglect sexual health and appropriate testing.

### If you remember only 3 things from Chapter 6

1.  Many "menopause symptoms" are actually **arthritis, depression, or thyroid disease**---screen, don't assume.

2.  Thyroid dysfunction is **common and increasing with age**, and its symptoms frequently overlap with the transition.

3.  Midlife doesn't mean the end of sexual health---STI risk, screening, and counseling remain important.

Study Sheet 7 -- **Osteoporosis**
--------------------------------

### Bird's-eye view

This chapter covers **bone biology, diagnosis, and management** of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It emphasizes when to screen with DXA, how to interpret T-scores and fracture risk tools (FRAX), evaluation for secondary causes, and the roles of nonpharmacologic measures and major medication classes.

### Must-know bullets

-   **Core definition**: Osteoporosis = compromise in bone strength (density + quality) that increases fracture risk; DXA remains the principal clinical tool.

-   **Who to screen**: DXA in all postmenopausal women with risk factors (including all ≥65 and younger women with significant risk factors).

-   **Secondary causes**: Table 1 lists medications (glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, anticonvulsants, etc.), endocrine disorders, GI diseases, genetic disorders, and other conditions that cause bone loss.

-   **Primary vs secondary osteoporosis**: Primary = low peak bone mass + age/estrogen-related loss; secondary = bone loss due to another disease/medication.

-   **Clinical evaluation**: History (fractures, height loss, falls), exam (height, kyphosis, tenderness, muscle strength), and labs (CBC, calcium, creatinine, ALP, albumin, phosphate, 24h urine Ca).

-   **Advanced labs**: Consider vitamin D, cortisol, SPEP/UPEP, TSH, celiac markers, PTH for atypical or unexplained cases.

-   **Treatment goals**: Reduce fragility fractures via fall reduction, lifestyle, calcium/vitamin D, and pharmacologic therapy (antiresorptives, anabolic agents).

### If you remember only 3 things from Chapter 7

1.  **DXA + clinical risk factors** (e.g., FRAX) guide who to treat, not BMD alone.

2.  Always look for **secondary causes** before labeling osteoporosis "primary."

3.  Goal is **fracture prevention**, combining fall prevention, lifestyle, and appropriate pharmacotherapy.

Study Sheet 8 -- **Cardiometabolic Disorders in Midlife Women**
--------------------------------------------------------------

*(CVD risk, HTN, lipids, metabolic syndrome, diabetes)*

### Bird's-eye view

This chapter lays out **cardiometabolic risk** in midlife women: CVD epidemiology, risk factors, prevention, and management of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. It stresses that CVD is the **leading cause of death in women** and that menopause coincides with---but is not solely responsible for---rising risk.

### Must-know bullets

-   **Chapter structure**: Cardiovascular health, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome/prediabetes/diabetes.

-   **CVD & menopause**: Menopause itself doesn't clearly accelerate absolute CVD rates, but does accelerate adverse changes in lipids, fat distribution, and BP.

-   **Ideal CV health**: TC <200, BP <120/80, FBG <100, BMI <25, no smoking, regular moderate/vigorous activity, healthy diet.

-   **Lifestyle**: Smoking cessation, heart-healthy diet (Mediterranean/DASH-style), and regular aerobic + resistance exercise are core recommendations.

-   **Hypertension**: Highly prevalent after 60; >75% of women >60 and ≥41% of postmenopausal women have HTN. BP shows a "bump" around menopause.

-   **HTN consequences**: Major cause of CVD morbidity and mortality; lifetime risk of HTN after 55 is ~90% in both sexes.

-   **Diabetes & cardiometabolic risk**: Chapter cites ADA and other guidelines for glycemic targets and CVD risk management in diabetes.

### If you remember only 3 things from Chapter 8

1.  **CVD is the #1 health threat** to postmenopausal women---prevention is central to menopause care.

2.  Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes must be **actively screened and treated** in midlife.

3.  Lifestyle (diet, exercise, quitting smoking) remains the **foundation** of cardiometabolic risk reduction.

* * * * *

Study Sheet 9 -- **Cancers Common in Midlife Women**
---------------------------------------------------

### Bird's-eye view

This chapter reviews cancers particularly relevant to midlife/postmenopausal women---breast, endometrial, ovarian, colorectal, etc.---emphasizing **risk factors (especially age & obesity)**, screening, early detection, and survivorship care.

### Must-know bullets

-   **One-in-three lifetime risk**: Women have about a 1 in 3 chance of developing cancer during their lifetime.

-   **Women-specific or predominant cancers**: Cervical, uterine, ovarian are unique to women; breast, lung, colorectal, uterine are the most common registry-reported cancers.

-   **Age & obesity**: Rising cancer incidence is largely driven by population aging and obesity.

-   **Obesity's role**: Strongly linked to breast, uterine, ovarian, and colorectal cancers via hormonal and metabolic mechanisms.

-   **Early detection & survivorship**: Improved screening and therapy mean more survivors; primary care is key for lipid, bone, and secondary cancer screening and lifestyle counseling.

### If you remember only 3 things from Chapter 9

1.  **Cancer risk rises with age and obesity**---core to counseling midlife women.

2.  Breast, uterine, ovarian, and colorectal cancers are the **big four** to think about in menopausal visits.

3.  Survivorship care (lipids, bone, other screenings, lifestyle) is often **your job** as the general clinician.

* * * * *

Study Sheet 10 -- **Vitamins, Minerals, and Other Dietary Supplements**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bird's-eye view

This chapter digs into how vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements are regulated and used, especially for bone health, cardiometabolic risk, and general wellness in midlife women. It clarifies the **regulatory difference** between foods, drugs, and dietary supplements and reviews evidence for calcium, vitamin D, and other commonly used products.

### Must-know bullets

-   **Regulatory framework**: DSHEA allows many dietary supplements to be marketed without pre-proof of safety or efficacy, unless they cross into "drug claim" territory.

-   **Evolving role of supplements**: The role and marketing of supplements in US diets has changed substantially since the original 1938 FDCA.

-   **Calcium & vitamin D**: Meta-analyses and guideline documents summarize fracture prevention data and recommended intakes by life stage.

-   **Optimal vitamin D**: Discussion of appropriate 25(OH)D levels, benefits, and risk-benefit assessment of supplementation, especially in osteoporosis prevention.

### If you remember only 3 things from Chapter 10

1.  Dietary supplements live in a **regulatory gray zone**---patients often overestimate their testing and safety.

2.  Calcium + vitamin D are important for bone, but fracture prevention data are **nuanced and not magic**.

3.  Always ask what patients are taking; supplements can interact with meds and sometimes cause harm or false reassurance. (General principle grounded in the regulatory discussion.)

* * * * *

Study Sheet 11 -- **Prescription Therapies**
-------------------------------------------

*(Contraceptives, HT, SERMs, statins)*

### Bird's-eye view

This chapter ties everything together by walking through **prescription hormonal and nonhormonal therapies** commonly used in perimenopause and postmenopause---contraceptives, estrogen therapy (ET), estrogen--progestogen therapy (EPT), SERMs/TSECs, and statins for lipid management. It includes US MEC categories, product tables, dosing, contraindications, and pros/cons of different routes.

### Must-know bullets

-   **Chapter structure**: Contraceptives → ET/EPT → bioidentical HT → SERMs/TSECs → statin guidelines.

-   **Role of prescription hormones**: Includes contraceptives, HT, androgens, ERAAs, and OTC hormones; some on-label, some off-label.

-   **Premature/early menopause**: Women with premature or early menopause should generally receive HT until the average age of menopause to prevent consequences of early estrogen loss.

-   **HT benefits**: Proven to prevent osteoporosis and reduce fracture risk; extended low-dose use can be considered for persistent VMS in carefully selected women.

-   **GSM treatment**: Low-dose vaginal estrogen or intravaginal DHEA can be used at any age with minimal risk and without opposing progestogen.

-   **Testosterone in women**: Used off-label for sexual interest/arousal disorders; no FDA-approved formulation in US/Canada.

-   **Compounded hormones**: Not recommended when FDA-approved therapies exist due to safety, regulation, dosing, and purity concerns.

-   **US MEC & SPR**: MEC categorizes contraceptive safety by condition; SPR explains how and when to initiate methods and when exams are required---core tools for contraceptive decision-making in midlife.

### If you remember only 3 things from Chapter 11

1.  In women with **premature/early menopause**, HT to the average age of menopause is standard to protect bone and overall health.

2.  Use **FDA-approved products** whenever possible; avoid routine reliance on compounded "bioidentical" hormones.

3.  The **US MEC + SPR** frameworks are your best friends for safe contraceptive decisions in midlife women with comorbidities.
