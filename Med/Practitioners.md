Fabled Sky Research | Press Briefing (STEM)
===========================================

**Title:** The "New" Executive Order That Isn't New---And the Medicare Mechanics Patients Actually Feel\
**Authors:** Sheraf Khan (Fabled Sky Research) and **Vicky Birger, MSN, FNP-BC** (Family Nurse Practitioner; Community Health + Women's Health; AI in Healthcare advisor)

Why this briefing exists
------------------------

A short post from ANA-Illinois titled "What does the new executive order (EO) mean for nurses?" is circulating again. It frames an executive order as if it were a near-term lever for "equal pay for equal work," reduced supervision requirements, and expanded APRN practice.

The post is not "wrong," but it mixes three different layers of reality that people routinely collapse into one:

1.  **Executive order language** (directional intent),
2.  **Medicare regulation** (what CMS can change via rulemaking), and
3.  **Medicare statute + payer implementation** (what actually shows up in clinics, denials, staffing, and patient access).

This briefing separates them---then answers the only question that matters: **what changes on Monday morning for patients and clinicians?**

* * * * *

1) What the ANA-Illinois article is literally saying
----------------------------------------------------

The ANA-Illinois post states that President Trump signed an EO on **October 3** relating to Medicare policy proposals, and that **Section 5** would direct HHS---within one year---to propose reforms affecting APRNs and PAs.

The post lists four "would" items, including:

-   eliminating excessive supervision requirements, and
-   "equal pay for equal work," described as Medicare reimbursing APRNs/PAs at the same level as physicians for the same procedures.

It also correctly notes that executive orders are broad and that changes would go through the **federal regulatory process** (proposed rule + public comment).

**Key factual point:** the EO being discussed is from **2019**, not a newly issued 2025 EO.

* * * * *

2) What EO 13890 actually says (and what it does not)
-----------------------------------------------------

EO 13890 ("Protecting and Improving Medicare for Our Nation's Seniors") is dated **October 3, 2019**.

### What Section 5 actually directs

Within one year, HHS "shall propose reforms" to enable providers to spend more time with patients by:

-   eliminating Medicare billing/participation/supervision/licensure requirements that are *more stringent than applicable federal or state law* and that limit practice "at the top of their profession,"
-   ensuring appropriate reimbursement for time spent with patients across health professions,
-   and reviewing policies that create reimbursement disparities and proposing a regulation that---**to the extent allowed by law**---reimburses items/services "in accordance with the work performed rather than the clinician's occupation."

### The single sentence that matters for "does this change anything tomorrow?"

EO 13890 explicitly says it **does not create any enforceable right or benefit**.

**Translation:** the EO is a steering memo, not a switch. The "switch" is statute + regulation + payer operations.

* * * * *

3) The most important correction: "Equal pay for equal work" is not what the EO guarantees
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANA-Illinois uses a clear phrase---"equal pay for equal work... reimbursing APRNs and PAs at the same level as physicians."

But the EO itself uses softer, conditional language: "appropriately reimbursed... in accordance with the work performed rather than the clinician's occupation," **to the extent allowed by law**.

That difference is not semantics. It's the difference between:

-   **headline aspiration**, and
-   **a payment system currently pinned to statutory ratios and long-standing billing pathways.**

For example, CMS's own APRN payment guidance states Medicare pays APRN professional services at **80% of the lesser of the actual charge or 85% of the physician fee schedule amount** (in the contexts CMS describes).

So if someone reads the ANA post and walks away thinking, "Medicare is about to pay NPs the same as physicians," that's not supported by the primary sources above.

4) What this means in day-to-day life (patients → nurses → clinicians → systems → insurers)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A) Patients

**What you will notice immediately because of EO 13890:** usually nothing, because the EO itself isn't a direct benefit and requires follow-on regulation and implementation.

**What you *will* notice when Medicare policy changes become operationalized:**

-   **Access:** more (or fewer) available appointment slots depending on how organizations staff and bill.
-   **Friction:** more forms, fewer forms, or---more commonly---**different** forms.
-   **Delays/denials:** especially when payers introduce new utilization controls.

In 2025--2026, the most "felt" change for many Medicare patients is not this 2019 EO---it's the emerging reality of **prior authorization in Original Medicare via a CMS Innovation Center model**.

CMS's **WISeR model** explicitly plans to use AI/ML + human review and run from **Jan 1, 2026 through Dec 31, 2031**, in **six states (NJ, OH, OK, TX, AZ, WA)**.\
Reporting has emphasized concerns about delays/denials and incentives when private entities are paid based on reducing "unnecessary" services.

**Practical patient translation:** if you're in a WISeR state and your service falls into the targeted categories, you may experience something that feels like Medicare Advantage utilization management---but inside "traditional Medicare."

### B) Staff nurses (RN) and bedside teams

EO language about "top of profession" often lands at the bedside in indirect ways:

-   **more protocolized care navigation** (because someone has to "make the chart legible to the payer"),
-   **more cross-team coordination** when coverage hinges on documentation precision,
-   and a continued shift of certain services to outpatient settings as "site neutrality" pressures build.

Vicky's clinical trajectory makes this real. She spent years in high-acuity telemetry and stroke care (NIHSS assessments, post-angiogram/angioplasty workflows), where "documentation" isn't paperwork---it's literally how the team maintains shared truth under time pressure. That's exactly the environment where policy doesn't arrive as a memo; it arrives as **new constraints** on what can be ordered, where it can happen, and what gets reimbursed.

### C) Nurse practitioners / APRNs

For APRNs, the day-to-day impact is dominated by **three mechanics**:

1.  **Payment baselines:** CMS still describes the 85% framework for APRN professional services in key contexts.
2.  **Billing pathways ("incident to," etc.):** CMS defines incident-to requirements and supervision expectations; this influences how groups structure visits and attribution.
3.  **Institutional policy:** even if Medicare supervision rules loosen, hospitals/clinics may keep internal supervision, privileging, and sign-off rules.

Vicky's current work as an FNP in a community health center (primary care, preventive screenings, contraception counseling/device insertion, comprehensive labs/imaging/referrals; serving English and Russian-speaking patients) grounds this in patient reality: access gains are only real if the clinic can **schedule**, **bill**, and **retain staff** without turning every visit into a compliance obstacle course.

### D) Physicians (MD/DO)

Physicians tend to feel these shifts as:

-   reduced or restructured supervision burden (sometimes),
-   changes in attribution/revenue flow depending on billing models,
-   and increased responsibility for "exception handling" when payer logic conflicts with clinical judgment.

In practice: when systems chase efficiency, physicians often become the escalation layer for denial risk, appeal narratives, and "medical necessity framing"---even when they didn't deliver the bulk of the visit.

### E) Nurse practitioners in women's health settings

Vicky's year in outpatient women's health (well-woman exams, STD screening/treatment, LARC placement, contraception counseling, cervical cancer screening) matters because women's health often lives at the boundary between:

-   preventive care (clear pathways), and
-   services that trigger utilization review (less predictable pathways).

When "policy changes" hit women's health, they can show up as:

-   changes to coverage rules,
-   changes to coding/documentation thresholds,
-   or changes to the staffing model that determines whether patients are offered timely LARC placement vs a follow-up three weeks later.

### F) Insurers and "the healthcare system"

This is the hard truth: the public talks about "scope of practice," but the system runs on **payment design + administrative control**.

EO 13890 points at reducing burden, but contemporary Medicare reality is also moving toward **technology-enabled payment integrity** (and therefore, new forms of friction). WISeR is explicit about using enhanced technologies and earlier review in the claims process.\
Independent policy analysis has raised concerns about delays/denials, beneficiary protections, and guardrails when AI enters authorization decisions.

* * * * *

5) The calendar is policy: telehealth is the clearest example
-------------------------------------------------------------

Patients and clinicians don't experience "telehealth policy" as philosophy. They experience it as "will Medicare pay for this visit when I'm at home?"

CMS's Telehealth FAQ (CY 2026) states:

-   **Through Jan 30, 2026**, beneficiaries can receive Medicare telehealth services "anywhere."
-   Starting **Jan 31, 2026**, geographic/originating site restrictions generally return, except for certain behavioral health rules.

**Day-to-day translation:** if telehealth coverage narrows, appointment availability, follow-up adherence, and clinical workload all shift---especially in behavioral health and chronic disease management.

* * * * *

6) Where Vicky's AI-in-healthcare lens belongs in this story
------------------------------------------------------------

Vicky's background isn't a decorative co-author line. It changes the analysis.

She has worked across:

-   EMT transport and coordination with public safety systems,
-   inpatient telemetry and stroke care at scale,
-   outpatient women's health,
-   and now primary care in a community health center with language access needs (English/Russian).

That arc maps perfectly onto the real terrain where "AI in healthcare" becomes consequential:

-   **AI as documentation + coding pressure** (what clinicians must record to be paid)
-   **AI as utilization management** (what gets approved/denied)
-   **AI as workflow design** (who does what, and who becomes the escalation layer)

And WISeR makes the policy/AI convergence explicit: CMS is institutionalizing the idea that "appropriate care" can be adjudicated partly through enhanced technology (AI/ML) plus clinical review.

As reporting and policy commentary emphasize, this is exactly where risks emerge: delays, opaque denials, disparity amplification, and incentive misalignment when savings become the success metric.

7) What we would tell a patient, a nurse, and a clinic administrator in one sentence each
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Patient:** An executive order doesn't change your coverage tomorrow; what changes your life is when Medicare (or your plan) changes the rules of approval---and those changes are increasingly mediated by technology.

**Nurse:** Policy won't arrive as "scope of practice expansion"; it will arrive as new documentation demands, new approval pathways, and new escalation protocols---especially if prior authorization expands.

**Clinic administrator:** If you want "more time with patients," measure clinician time directly---because regulation reduction and AI-enabled utilization control can cancel each other out in practice.

Disclosure and bias statement (draft)
-------------------------------------

This briefing is published under Fabled Sky Research press briefings. The authors bring explicit clinical and systems bias: we prioritize patient access, safety, and clinician time, and we are skeptical of "burden reduction" claims that are not measured in practice---particularly when AI-mediated utilization controls expand.
